i'll lay quietly next to you
so you won't wake up
because i know how hard it is for you to fall right back asleep

because honey i'd tear myself in two
if it meant you get to live your life the way you've always wanted to

i'll sleep with my eyes half open
so i know the ghosts won't get to you
because i know how much nightmares get to your head and mess you up

because honey i swore i'd love you
if it meant i'll forget everything else and remember it's all for you

i watched you cry yourself breathless
i could only sit there and kiss your shoulders
tears stream quietly past my cheek
i'd give up my beautiful life just so you could have one that you rightfully deserve
how come such an angel clip off its wings every single day? 
how come such a sweet siren lose its voice every single night?

for a million years, i love you
for a million lives, i was born to love you
nothing could ever shake my will to love
not even the possibility that this could all end someday

and even if the moon refuses to shine down on me once more
your light is the only thing i'd hope for

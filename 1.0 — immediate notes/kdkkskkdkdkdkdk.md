G - C - A - G
i'll lay quietly next to you
G - D - B
so you won't wake up
G - D
because i know how hard it is for you to fall right back asleep

G - D#
because honey i'd tear myself in two
D - B
if it meant you get to live your life the way you've always wanted to

G - C - A - G#
i'll sleep with my eyes half open
G - D - B
so i know the ghosts won't get to you
G - D
because i know how much nightmares get to your head and mess you up

G - D#
because honey i swore i'd love you
D - B
if it meant i'll forget everything else and remember it's all for you

i watched you cry yourself breathless
i could only sit there and kiss your shoulders
tears stream quietly past my cheek
i'd give up my beautiful life just so you could have one that you rightfully deserve
how come such an angel clip off its wings every single day?

F# - G - D - D#  F - D
for a million years, i love you
F# - G - D - D#  F - D# - C# - B A# - G - F# - C
for a million lives, i was born to love you
G - C - D - B
but i'm losing myself and i'm afraid you're going to lose me too

G - B - C# - B    A# - G# G - G# A - B
and even if the moon refuses to shine down on me once more
G - A# - A  E - D 
your light is the only thing i'd hope for

==ストレイトピーポル、なぜ？== 
-- 
ここに誰にも僕を知る
-- 
えっ— 僕は何を覚えてみているか？
何を忘れちゃって覚えられない！
--
友達は「わっ！君の日本語はペラペラだ！」って言ってた。 上手じゃないよ！毎日もっと勉強しなきゃ T__T

==漢字を書けたら、読める。 これは僕のナンバー1ルールだ。 時間かかるけど、楽しい。==

「台風が降っても、地震があっても、僕そこに見に来る。何もできる。愛の力があった。君だから！死ぬまで、君を選ぶ。死ぬまで、もっといつも愛する。だから、戻ってください。なくならなくてください。僕と一緒にいて。永遠に一緒にいましょう。」 「あのう。。これはマクドナルドだ。。」

4時間ぐらい中国の映画を見てしまうはずだけど、寝ちゃった!
--
クリック。 写真。 アカウント。 デリート。 さようなら、友達。
--
最近twitterをあまり使わない
ちょっと忙しかった
そしてこの本を読んで、 "digital minimalism" という本だ
勉強もできなかった
--
明日病院に薬を取りに行かなきゃ
--
金があるけど何を買うか分からん
--
今日外歩く間に死んだ猫を見た 白い猫だ
--
大学に行く前に280日ぐらい日本語を勉強しなければいけない
--
毎日バカみたい感じる
--
日本が存在しなくなったら、僕の人生は目的を失うでしょうか?
--
人生の変化は早い
--
誰も知らない僕の一部分がある
--
僕は多分僕が知っている中で最も孤独な人間だ
--
泣いてた。2時間ぐらい泣いてた。なぜ泣いてたか知らない。
--
お正月が来ます
来年、もっと勉強しつもりだが楽しみます
--
何もために気分じゃないの
--
来年1月に仕事があればいいね
--
意外にもう痛くなかった。今新しい人間みたい！
--
僕たちはいつも良いものを手に入れることができるわけではない
--
仕事を必要とする
--
誰かに「今夜の月は本当に明るく見えるね」って言ってたけど、その人は何も言わなかった。好きじゃなかったと思った。
でも、その月は本当に明るく見えた。ほら、見て！
--
明日面接が3件ある！！仕事がもらうといいんだけど !
--
死にたい。本当に死にたい。 ごめん、僕の友達。 誰が僕を助けるかは分からない。 後で、午前3時ごろ、出るつもりだ。 何をするか知らない。 もうこの世界では生きたくない。もうやだ。。 すごく疲れた。 これは僕の最後の歌、多分。
--
愛したと思ってた
幸いしなかった
--
なぜ僕は怖すぎるか分からない
いつも僕の方が他の人よりいいと思ってた
だから自分で毎日「僕は最低だ」と言ってた
それはレアルだ
--
後で家族と泳ぎに行くことにした
ちょっと落ち込んでるけど、しょうがないんだ
--
本を書くことにした
--
どうしようかなあ、、、
--
最も深い孤独 泳ぎ方を忘れちゃった
--
12時間勉強していました もう僕の限界です。。。。
--
おやすみ。明日は良くなるといいんだけど。
--
4年前、僕は普通な人間だった。いったい何が起こったんだ？
--
==コーヒーを飲みすぎちゃった==
--
==暑い。。。夏か？本当。。。==
--
あなたには奇妙すぎるかもしれないねえ
--
これからコーヒーに砂糖と牛乳を入れないことにした
--
僕の両親が親であることに疲れたらどうするか？そのとき僕は何をする？ まだ大人じゃない。時々死ぬの方がいいとおもう。
--
初めてのことが多くて、最初色々なことが大変だと感じるかもしれないけど、この国でしばらく生活していくから、心配しなくてもいいよ。
--
==今年は大学に入学できないかもしれない。僕の予定は今もっと勉強するつもりで12月JLPTに取って来年翻訳者の仕事を探すことにした。それから、父さんと母さんに手伝ってあげる。だから、僕は頑張らなきゃ！！==
--
真夜中に いつも 君を 考えている
--
やりたいことをやる、僕を止められない！！！！　何を言うかは気にしない！！！
--
一回じゃなく三回一緒に会った。君のとして、それを足りるかもしれない。そのあと、ぜんぜん話さなかった。
僕達はまだ友達か？
最後に会った時、一日の終わりまでに、カフェで君は静かになった。なぜ？
電車で隣りに座りながら、誰にも話さなかった。突然、行かなきゃ。「またね。」って言った。でも、君は微笑んだけだ。なぜ？なぜ何も話さなかった？
「なぜ静かになれた？」って聞いた、あの日後で。「多分疲れた。」は君の言葉。信じらなかった。
あれから一ヶ月経ってあの日をまだ考えている。何かが間違っていることは知ったいるのに、君はは教えてくれなかった。ぜんぜん何も話さなかった。
だから、本を読む代わりに、これを思い出している。今バカみたいな感じている。
--
金がないの選んだ
--
午前3時は静かで気持ちがいいから、どうすれば寝られる？
--
やりたくなくても、時にやりたくなくても、それをやって。やりたくないと感じても問題ない。大事なことは、絶対にやるのだ
--
今から毎日和歌を書くつもりだ
そして一つ数学の問題も答えるつもり
--
今日中に それは一つだけ質問がある: 「生活の目的は何？」 答えは: 「わかんない。でも、生活を生かして欲しい。」
--
完全に一人になってやっと自由になれると思う
--
大事なことが無くしたのが怖い

==どうやってこのアニメを続ける 僕はもう感じがない==
--
==10年とっても、君を戻るのため待つ。 僕たちがまだ終わらない。==
--
==皆はいなくなった==
==残っているのは芸術だけだ==
--
ときどきここで英語で喋りたい。 でも、「じゃ、どうやって日本語をよく習うの？」って考えた。 それで、もっと日本語で話す、難しくても。

君は「さようなら」って言ってくれて欲しい。

背中が痛い。。 僕は長い間ベッドに横たわっていた

==ive been thinking alot about how i was teetering on the edge of being morally ambiguous and a "good" person. i didn't know who i wanted to be and i feel like everyone already knew they wanted to be a good person. i don't even know why i had that choice.==

==and i thought being a bad person, if i were to be one, or if i already am, it's just a nuisance. there's nothing beneficial to come out of it. i could live a "neutral" life, that's quite a favorable outcome, however i would risk being a social outcast—which isn't so bad.==

==i bet there's a whole study about this in philosophy but i just haven't looked more into it. it's like, i can't decide who i want to be yet, without knowing what being "me" really means. as well as being a "good" or "bad" or "neutral" person.==

==didn't realize having a choice would be this heavy.==

--
people find it weird that i tend to be close friends with significantly younger people and ask "why couldn't u befriend people ur age?" as if i'm not unemployed and not in college and people my age don't spend most of their time graduating college or having a job

or maybe people my age spend less time on the internet and younger people are more active online

or maybe i'm just very immature idk

what the hell does that even mean????????
--
literally lied my ass off on the roblox therapy xDD i feel bad she was so serious about it too
--
the fact that i've never considered myself a "gamer" just because i barely owned any console like ps4 or xbox or nintendo ds etc, i just had a phone, tablet, and pc. even though i've been playing games for as long as i can remember and have been obsessed for most of my life

i dont play RDR, overwatch, elden ring, dark souls, etc or what "gamers" usually play which is stupid that that has been my idea of being a "real" gamer.. i just play what i have at the moment and be addicted at that

i have been addicted to: pokemon, osu, roblox, flash games (on y8 mostly and newgrounds, armorgames), simulation games (sims, mobile tycoons, etc), rpgs (like spiral knights, dragon nest, etc), facebook games, dating sims, wii, tekken, plants va zombies, RHYTHM GAMES ETC ETC

although i have played popular PC games too like slenderman, left for dead, GTA, minecraft, starcraft, DOTA etc. oh as well as card games irl like yugioh, bakugan, and duel masters i even joined guilds n shit. i played some stuff on psp too like fairy tail, project diva, etcetc

ive played a lot of shit in my life and i've loved games for as long as i can remember idk why that died out and i lost motivation to even START a game even though no one has judged me at all, its just my own perception lol

tho now i play D&D too :3 which is super fun and i dont plan on quitting soon

loving music—not in a music critic, album reviewer, song analyst type of way or a perfect pitch, violinist, music theory, playing in a band type of way or even a song recommender, radio DJ, lyric-memorizing type of way—but in my strange esoteric in-my-own-world type of way.
--
i beat the shit out of myself in my mind everytime i forget a crucial fact about someone
--
==i will always grieve for the infinite lives i didn't choose but i won't ever regret this one life i chose==

am i stupid or do i just need a lot of time to think about things first before settling with a thought or am i actually stupid

being content doesn't necessarily mean the future doesn't matter. it's that whether you have a tomorrow or not, whatever happens today should be enough.

==it pains me to remember that most people don't hold the same amount of compassion and patience for everyone else==

==it pains me to remember that some people will always have ill intent for others for their own benefit==

==all these unnecessary hate and suffering==

==it doesn't have to be this way==

==when i encounter shitty people with shitty lives making shitty decisions, it's hard to feel anger. i can only feel a profound sense of sadness.==

==i know they didn't choose the path to malice. nobody wants to live a life like that. they hurt because they're hurt—but that doesn't make it okay, still. i don't accept their behavior but i UNDERSTAND.==

--
==omw to become an enlightened being==
--
my art style is whatever the fuck happens when i make art
--
i subject myself to infinite digital consumerism and media consumption
--
==i love music so much so much i will breathe it in i will swallow it i will engrave it everywhere on my skin i will ingest it in my heart and brain i will pump it in my blood i will give birth to it i will intertwine it with my soul i will transcend alongside it==
--
==i'm not even gonna pretend i know shit i don't know shit unfortunately==
--
==what's the use of consuming millions of art when you couldn't take away a single thing from all of it?==
--
i'm living my life now as if nothing more could possibly make me happier than i am today. it will never be perfect—it may be subjected to more suffering or it may have the possibility of significant improvement—but i accept the reality of the present, whatever it may be.
--
i can live like kafka tamura for a whole year (when he was in the isolated cabin with only records and books)
--
it's not like i've forgotten about my traumas. there may be times i'm desensitized and i become indifferent, but in that way i can see it for what it really is: past events that have altered my life's course. i acknowledge that it's there and i accept that it's a part of me.

i'm changed because of it and i wouldn't be who i am today without it. it's terribly unfortunate that the child me has gone through everything and i wish things were better, but it happened and i can't change that anymore. the best thing to do now is move forward. life goes on.

laging sinasabi na i'm already independent sa work and kaya ko na sarili ko without needing much assistance. napapansin ko rin na i haven't been experiencing much difficulties with handling customers, probably because di pa mahirap mga cases ko OR it boils down to my competence.

and it got me thinking, it doesn't feel like i'm exerting much effort to improve. and i'm talking "conscious" efforts. it feels like i'm on autopilot, i just KNOW what to do. and so far, i've only trusted the belief that i can somehow do it. but what if i stopped being competent?

what if suddenly, my brain just loses hold of all the information i've learned in training? or that i just forget what to do when i have to do it? what if i forget to ask questions? what if i forget how to deal with processes? these thoughts really scare me. i'm not in control.

i don't like just trusting that my brain can hold being on autopilot for so long. i can already feel it slipping away by forgetting bits and pieces. i already felt myself being lost on what to do earlier. iguess i just want confidence that i can do it & that i don't want to fail.

i remember christmas of 2019, my family rented a vacation house in tagaytay. and instead of enjoying my time with my family, i sat on a warm corner of a room—on the floor, a pillow under my bottom, a warm mug of coffee beside me, and the cold breeze coming through the window.

i sat there for the entire day, 10 hours perhaps, reading this book called "black order" that my friend gave me for my birthday. no one bothered me, i was left alone. i was not expected to socialize at all. it was the most fun i've ever had on a christmas day.

sometimes when you let love flow freely through you, patience and understanding become like breathing. it wouldn't take a lot of you to just be gentle. some would say it would cost you your sense of self but what i feel is that, it will GIVE you your self. you just let it.

i don't know but despite all the pain inside me, my illness taking over me, and this mortal body limiting my every move—i transcend. i look at her, and i can just feel myself becoming more than human. it's unexplainable, but one thing's for sure is that i'd do everything for her.

one might ask, 'you've never felt love before so how can you be so sure that his is love?' and i probably won't have the answers that would satisfy them. all i know is that, this feeling, could stretch through infinity, even mortality, all for a single smile from a person.

im probably gonna be unemployed and not in college for the next 5 years my mom's gonna die my dad's gonna die my brother will move out i will have no friends at all what the fuck now does it fucking matter anymore living is suffering i will suffer every single day

i have one single person i'm in love with and who loves me and will stay with me for eternity and if she dies i die. i have hands and a mind that can create something out of nothing i have a soul that feels for every single living being i will not ask for more.

i might kill myself anytime soon or not but until then i will hug my girlfriend as she sleeps i will dream of a life and a family with her and i will yearn to create every single day because goddamnit if not for that then what is it all for

im so fucking angry i want to just scream at everyone its like all the pent-up anger bubbling up to the surface it makes me hate being so understanding because i would always have sympathy and explanation for every single person ever i hate it

my dad is a miserable fuck and i just wanna yell at his face that if he's miserable don't drag others down but i can't help but think all the fucked up shit happening to him made him that way and i know what it feels like to be unbearably miserable

our neighbor plays music so fucking loud in the morning but all i can think about is how it might just be the only thing that makes them feel like they're not alone and to avoid the feeling of being miserable because who the fuck stays down there his entire life doing nothing

all these teenagers on tiktok complaining about things under privileged lenses and bringing down others just to make them feel good but all i can see are sad miserable fuckers who were not given enough attention as children and i cant imagine how the world has been so unkind

my sister ignoring everything and everyone even when we try to speak to her properly but all i can think about is how miserable she must have felt, too much so, that it disables her ability to speak for just how overwhelmed she is of everything and every burden of responsibility

i wish i could see these things without the expense of my own emotions and anger but dear god it's a curse to always see the bright side and be blindly ignorant to their own accountability

my head and throat hurts so fucking bad because i want to cry in frustration that these things happen and the world is so fucking miserable i just see it

your childhood traumas got a certain way of running to you at 4000 km/h, slam at you full-body force with 5 million metric tons, when you're finally peaceful and defenseless, and honestly?
--
just because you've felt the purest love with someone, doesn't necessarily mean you'd get to spend the rest of your life with them. 

reading "the seven husbands of evelyn hugo" taught me that possibility. and i think that's one of the biggest tragedies life can ever offer.

as i lay here wide awake at almost three in the morning next to the love of my life, with that thought, i can't help but get choked up with tears about the uncertainty of it all. who knows what's going to happen next? who knows if our love still continues to bloom into tomorrow?

this moment is all i have.

the child inside weeps and thrashes about. "the world is unfair," says the unyielding adult. they turned to the kid laying on the floor with his eyes wet and cheeks red. "you're a grownup now. nothing more can be done."
--
like a stale birthday cake left in the refrigerator for several days, i became damp with wet coldness. i meant good intentions at my core self, but somehow the ego desperately yelps out in irritation. it's hard to disidentify with this pain body because i yearn for a future where i am comfortable and free of anxiety—except it only amplifies it. it's like a feedback loop that feeds upon itself.
--
would it be unrealistic to have your heart open at all times? or perhaps what's more unrealistic is that we're all closed off? we weren't born with walls around ourselves, we built them with every brick as we age. not saying that's a bad thing, we need a sense of individuality or else we'd risk exposing ourselves to harm. but the walls got too high and we forgot that we were all human, after all, one and the same.
--
i started finally facing the real world. it looks bleak and dry. it's plastic and not available for growth. everyone's running around to places they don't want to be. i'm starting to wonder what i really want, after all. and when i think about it, all the reason i can think of is you. i'm doing all of this for you.
--
i'm not aware of a lot of things, but i'm aware that's a bad thing. this tends to hurt others, a detriment to myself too, i have spines growing on my back. they grow in length, and i have to cut them off with scissors every night. but you know, i'd rather make it a habit to snap those things out of my back just so i can love others properly, the way they need to be. i'm willing to go through anything, even keeping my eyes open while it hurts to do so, as it tears me apart, just so i can love. i was born to love, i think. no, i believe so. if there's no love, my life has no purpose anymore. so for the next year, that's what i'll keep in mind. that's what i look forward to. that's the reason i wake up every single day. that's the reason i breathe.
--
the path with the least vines and the sunlight peaking through the trees seems to be the most familiar, yet it's getting very distant now. before i knew it, tears were running down my cheeks and i'd still find ways to blame myself even after everything. and perhaps we weren't meant for this, right from the start.
--
i stop on my tracks and realized how ephemeral and fleeting everything is. as if blown by the wind gently, it all passes by fairly swiftly. it fills me with inexplicable sadness.  whatever i do or say now, it bears little weight in the grand scheme of things. this anxiety? gone by tomorrow. this self-loathing? gone by the few decades. this fucked up life? gone by the next lifetime. i'm a tiny speck of dust in a gigantic universe shifting and overturning. if nothing matters, does that really fucking matter then?
--
the lights are flashing and my eyes zoom past the barriers. i'm feeling fast and my hands are clutching the wheels. it's over—it's completely over but i'm still on hyperdrive. nothing seems to matter but the earth's my oyster. it's inside me because i swallowed it up whole. 35 degrees to the right and i can clutch my handgun; it's all so easy. but i have starry-eyes and i feel fucking fantastic.
--
the haunting of the glass globe resonates along the area—it echoes, and it appears as a shitty white spot in the night sky.
--
are humans truly capable of god-level understanding and patience? i'm trying to unlock that potential yet this ego shit keeps pulling at my heart and sheds uncontrollable emotions. perhaps the sooner i can accept that the human is limited, the better i can handle slight twinges of the soul.
--
is this the life i'm bound to live? 
will i waste my time hoping for transcendence?
the surpassing of human limitation? 
when will i finally accept the fact that i cannot be god?
--
i was planning on dying yesterday, that fact was not a lie. but i couldn't find a paper to write my last message on and i didn't want the inconvenience of bringing a large jug of water to wash down all the pills i plan on drinking. and what could i have said? "i'm sorry i'm worthless" or some shit. what good would that do? i felt so terrible for existing because i was capable of hurting others, and i didn't want that. i was probably really really selfish to choose being alive and to hug my girlfriend even if that may be the last, but i did just that anyways. i hugged her and i cried. hard. even though i felt so terrible for even crying, i couldn't stop it. my head hurt for fighting myself from ending it all and i felt scared how much i could've done it actually.
--
dear gods, if you take my soul tonight, i just want to let you know that i paved the way for you to come and get it. this is not your will but i willed you. it was inevitable.
--
it suddenly got quiet, i could almost hear the crickets in a cricket-less city of fools. the stars were shouting brightly and i couldn't keep my eyes off the bathroom wall. words got caught up in my throat, where the hell was the ketchup bottle?

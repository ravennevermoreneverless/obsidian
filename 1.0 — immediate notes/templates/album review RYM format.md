★★★★★ Naruto Themed Sexting

★★★★ Keanu Reaverbots

★★★★ I Hate Every Driver On The Road Except For Me

  

a short purely acoustic release by my guilty pleasure band that i've by far accepted that they'll always be one of my favorite bands despite their reputation because i stupidly believe in the idea of separating the art from the artists even though this EP's lyrics are literally written by the piece of shit human being responsible for their reputation but i'll pretend i don't see

  

[b][i]I Hate Every Driver On The Road Except For Me[/i][/b] introduces us to the nature of the next few songs as something close to heartache and pain. it opens up with the woman saying "it's over" or something along the lines of "you make me so fucking sick" but either way it's all noise in his head as his brain screams in agony. then comes [b][i]Keanu Reaverbots[/i][/b], admitting that a lot contributed to this failure of a relationship and it's mostly because of him. [i]slice into me, cut my body up into little pieces and put them together into something you'll be proud of[/i] because he knows he's a good-for-nothing asshole and this song is a cry of hope that she would stay if only she does something about him. which leads us to [b][i]Naruto Themed Sexting[/i][/b], a self-deprecating song but also an act of asking if this love can be mended still despite the wrongs he's done. he KNOWS he's a piece of shit and he STILL has the audacity to ask for love where he shouldn't deserve it. or at least, it's a desperation on his part. he knows he fucked up, but at the end of the day, he's still lonely and the child in him is heavily deprived of any kind of affection—tha: why he's fucked up, after all.

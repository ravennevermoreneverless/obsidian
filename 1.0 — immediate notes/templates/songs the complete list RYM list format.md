[tt][color ]the lyrics are as straightforward as it gets. a guy with low self-esteem clings towards the idea of a "lonely girl", wanting to be with her, because he is lonely himself. he wants to be the savior of this lonely girl when in truth, he's the one who needs saving. it might also imply that the girl isn't actually lonely and pathetic as he paints her to be, but he only builds upon that idea, just so he can feel like the knigh in shining armor for her. the lyrics [b][i]and if you need a little sunshine you can borrow some of mine. "it's okay if you're unhappy" i would say before i leave her. "just take a look around there's no one here who's happy either"[/b][/i] in the song paints this quotes as the guy uplifts the girl's low moods. but i think it's more of an encouragement for himself, words he wants to hear from the people around him. he projects his lonely self to the idealization of a lonely girl.[/color #FF3942][/tt]

[i]Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I could just sit and enjoy your company, your company[/i]

[tt][color #FE9696] 99 nights with kendall and dana, taking pictures of all of my drawings before leaving for QC, overwhelmed with the twins, i'll never be good with babies, spraining my ankle, mcdonald's cereal milk, spaghetti macaroni, buying a new mattress, morning kisses, day 508, restarting genki, the conjuring series, creating flashcards on obsidian, jollibee with nanay, wanting to shit at puregold, small disagreements which blew over, UMAK enrollment, saying mean things, crying for 2 hours, wanting to finally go away, emptiness, drop a poop, chai's stomach issues getting worse, having to go home and witness my gf get into a fight with her family, always arriving home when it's raining really really hard, tupad and frustration, spit towel, chasing millipedes in the morning, moving out again, finding out i have autism, a routine, N1 JLPT, feeling so much like a burden, bedtime story, hello glow skin care, multiple missed calls in one day,[/color #FE9696][/tt]

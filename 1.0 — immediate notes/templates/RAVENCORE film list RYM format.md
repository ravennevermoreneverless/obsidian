[JD](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm2362335/?ref_=ttqu_qu): Yeah, it used to say 'hate'. But to increase my chances of employment I had the E removed.
[Baby](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm5052065/?ref_=ttqu_qu): How's that working out for you?

[color #D20000][b]BEST SCENE(s)[/b][/color #D20000]

[i]there's usually two ways to have me instantly hooked on a film's opening sequence: gore and music. this didn't have any gore—it doesn't need it—but this made music usage in film so entertaining and it does it so well. i just knew i was in for a ride[/i]

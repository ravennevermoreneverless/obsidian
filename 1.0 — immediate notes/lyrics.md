i love her so much and that won't ever change, but if she ever wants to break up, i'll let her. 

i have no right to mend this relationship 
just so i can stay with you for longer,
everything's my fault, 
and that would be selfish.

you came back to me,
maybe that should be enough,
and i shouldn't ask for more 
anymore.

grief is a dangerous thing. 
one second i'm posting our pictures on the wall,
then i'm spending time with a silhouette.

"i knew we were going to break up" — a secret that readers slowly learn : immortal being who can't feel love 

i don't want to feel claustrophobic with you

so i'll lay quietly next to you
so you won't wake up
because i know how hard it is for you to fall right back asleep

because honey i'd tear myself in two
if it meant you get to live your life the way you've always wanted to

but i'm losing myself and i'm afraid you're going to lose me too

is it possible to fall for you even more as time goes by? what if i'm the only one falling long before the sun said goodbye?

shitty people can make good art just as much as good people can make shitty art.

if you find out the artist of your favorite piece of art is a garbage human, the art piece will still be the same, it won't change. what changed is that you became AWARE of the artist's personal morals. had you not found out about the artist, the art will remain good, as you see it.

just because i think they're a good artist, doesn't mean i think they deserve forgiveness. justice will always be due to those who have twisted morals and have committed crimes. i don't support what they're doing and what they've done, BUT THE ART IS STILL DAMN GOOD, you can't deny that.

as long as the artists are not advocating their horrible behaviors through their art, then i'll continue to consume their art. BUT I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THEM IN ANY WAY.

art can mean different things for different people and goes beyond the creators themselves. the issue arises when you defend an artist for their actions just because they make good art.

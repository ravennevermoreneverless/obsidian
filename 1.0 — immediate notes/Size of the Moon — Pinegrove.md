***Midwest Emo***
*Slacker Rock*

i've known this song for quite some time and now that i've actually listened to it carefully, without any distractions, i finally noticed the lack of traditional drums in this. sure, there were percussions but that's mostly it. the guitar more than makes up for the beats and rhythm, which is amazing on its own. the song starts withba calm strumming of the electric guitar, as hall reminisces a dance with his partner in the living room, which seems to be a significant place in his life, as he repeats it on the fourth verse. "*we had some good ideas but we never left that fucking room.*" could signify nothing moved or got better from then, or perhaps their relationship stayed the same. every verse opens up with a question "*do you wanna dance?*", "*do you wanna talk?*", "*would you like a drink?*" as if asking his partner questions just so he could prompt the person what they really want, to make things clear, to avoid further confusion. the second verse mentions his dad and how he talks to him about his problems, how he'd always have an advice from a book, then he has asked his dad the question "*if i did what i wanted, then why do i feel so bad?*"—he's probably never got a clear answer for this. the third verse lyric "*while we wait for everything to get good again?*" means things haven't looked up for quite some time, and he's lost on how to mend this quiet disagreement of hearts. chorus rolls in and it solidifies the feelings of doubt and fear with the relationship, afraid of the uncertainty of where this is going. "*but still, let's see. if nothing else, it's an idle curiosity.*" could mean that if this thing that's causing them pain cannot be explained, perhaps it's just a fear or a question at the back of his mind—perhaps the question of "can this be fixed?" or "is this still gonna work out?". the fourth verse comes in with background sounds of nature, birds and crickets, with the steady beating of percussion like a heartbeat. it was set in that same living room, where they've fought, then cried and laughed, because of something bigger than themselves—like the size of the moon. he wishes to go back to the way things were, where everything was still alright. the bridge goes "*do you wanna die? fine, you're right, but i wonder what it feels like? to stop feeling so alive. what if we could wake up in five years and things'd be feeling alright?*" where hall wishes to just fast forward where things are fixed, at least in that way, he'd know a sense of certainty, a promise of togetherness, still. and then the last chorus is a free shout-along part where you project yourself to the singer and feel all that he's feeling.

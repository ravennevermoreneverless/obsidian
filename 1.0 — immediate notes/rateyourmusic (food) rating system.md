==5.0== — ***pizza***; exploding with flavors and spices that i can never get enough of, cooked to perfection and has the right amount of tenderness and textures. each and every track is a MASTERPIECE, the flow from one track to another is flawless, and the general theme of the album is gracefully thought-out and then delivered masterfully. there's nothing even remotely terrible with this piece, i'm completely blown away and i will have no problems consuming this everyday for the rest of my life.

==4.5== — ***sandwich***; easy to consume because there are literally no bad tracks (just a few that gets paled in comparison to the absolute greatness of the other tracks but nothing big). the whole album still works wonders, i'm still awestruck every listen and it's definitely above average. no major complaints. it's one of, if not, the best album in an artist's discography.

==4.0== — ***sushi***; would for sure be willing to consume again voluntarily for long periods of time. still brimming with musical orgasms ready to be delivered. probably one or two skips but overall it's still heavily rich with flavors. 

==3.5== — ***chicken wings***; tons of of very well-made songs, some even masterpieces but wouldn't consider the whole album as one. it's pretty solid still and i would most likely listen to the entirety of the album if i were in the mood. 

==3.0== — ***squash soup***; works okay as a whole album. it's done its job, alright, but it's hardly anything close to mindblowing. the songs are re-listenable, some i actually consider amazing, but i would only listen to the album in passing. would've been rated higher if not for some songs in there that shouldn't've been included at all.   

==2.5== — ***mac and cheese***; average and mediocre record. passable, consumable, but just barely great. kinda bland and lacking in flavors. might not recommend, there are a few good songs tho.

==2.0== — ***tofu***; very subpar. barely any track from this record is worthy enough to be considered great. there is that one track that's desperately trying to save the album but the other songs are generally forgettable at most.

==1.5== — ***food WITH RAISINS***; very very weak record. there's hardly any redeeming qualities. album theme is not very concrete, there's no flow, not even some valuable lyrics or ear-catching melodies.  

==1.0== — ***fresh guacamole***; horrendous, extremely poor in quality. can't imagine ever enjoying it nor would ever want to listen to it again, ever. incoherent and questionable album, it's falling apart. 

==0.5== — ***matcha***; abomination, pure atrocity, and i absolutely hate it. i can't even finish the whole album because i am physically in pain. i would snip off my left ear with a scissor and sell it just so i can take back the minutes i wasted trying to listen to the songs. i would rather listen to the anguished screams of the tortured souls in hell rather than this disgusting excuse of a record.

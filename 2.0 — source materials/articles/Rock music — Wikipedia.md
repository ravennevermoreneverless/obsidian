## 1940s to 1950s : BIRTH OF ROCK AND ROLL
— foundations came from the US during the late 1940s and early 1950s
— origins were melded from black musical genres back them, like rhythm and blues, gospel music and country/western music

- ***Rock Around the Clock*** (1954) — *Bill Haley* : first rock and roll track to enter the billboard's main sales and opened the world to this genre 

— There was a decline in the rock genre by 1959, with the death of Buddy Holly, departure of Elvis Presley to the army, retirement of Little Richard, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. 

— spread out from the US though associating the 'americanization' events happening worldwide resulted from the second world war 
- ***Move It*** (1959) by Cliff Richard ushered in the sound of British rock.
- ***Wild One*** (1958) by John O'Keefe was one of the earliest Australian rock and roll hits. 
- ***Rock Island Line*** (1955) by Lonnie Donegan was a major influence and helped to develop and form a unique sound of small bands who play Rock and Roll like John Lennon's Quarrymen (later on The Beatles). 

— former rock and roll acts in the US became lightweight pop and ballads, the ones in the UK, more strongly influenced by blues-rock pioneers, developed rock music with their own touch and passion, another level of intensity, which will shape the future of rock music through the *British invasion*

## PLOT

One night, 14-year-old Madoka Kaname has a terrible nightmare - against the backdrop of a devastated city, she witnesses a girl fight a losing battle against a dreadful being lingering above, while a cat-like magical creature tells Madoka the only way to change such tragic outcome is for her to make a contract with him and become a magical girl. 

The next day, the teen's dream seemingly becomes reality as the girl she saw in her dream - Homura - arrives at Mitakihara Middle School as a transfer student, mysteriously warning Madoka to stay just the way she is; but when later on she and her best friend Sayaka encounter the same cat-like magical creature from her dream - who introduces himself as Kyubey - the pair discovers that magical girls are real, and what's more, they can choose to become one. All they must do is sign a contract with Kyubey and agree to take on the duty to fight abstract beings called 'witches' that spread despair to the human world, and in return, each one of them will be granted any single wish they desire. However, as Homura's omen suggests, there might be far more to becoming a magical girl than Madoka and Sayaka realize... 
## REVIEW

### 2025-10-11

> 「*たった一人の私の友達。あなたの。。あなたのためなら、私は永遠の迷路を閉じ込められても、構わない！*」

What starts out as a simple, ordinary, usual magical girl anime with a protagonist who has a potential greater than jesus christ himself, like any other, turns out to be one of the greatest, most engaging, deeply psychological animes released in the 2010's.

At first, I almost found it a bit boring. 'Oh, this is a really cliché magical girl anime where the main girl will be the most powerful of them all and it's a battle of good and evil and then there's a biiiig enemy at the end that she'll defeat because she's so powerful, then saving the world in the process, like it always is,' I thought to myself. Though I haven't watched any magical girl animes before. A know-it-all, that's who I was. A very wrong one, too. Because face it, the creators definitely wanted us to think it's no different than the others, making a great mislead that we didn't really expect. I mean, from the opening song itself (which is an absolute banger, by the way), it's showing all the magical girl bloopers and happy moments with Madoka, Sayaka, Kyouko, and Mami — except for Homura. You'd THINK it's all funs and smiles. They made you expect that it would play out the way it always would. But then short glimpses of attempted suicide, cultism, and *beheading* were shown, and your smile starts to twitch sideways, maybe scratch your head from time to time and ask, 'This is supposed to be fun and light-hearted, right?' 

Suddenly, time manipulation and entropy enters, with a dark-haired *kuudere* in tow and a cat mascot that is very punchable, plus a fuckton of devotion and going back in time. Few episodes near the end, it was revealed how witches were made, all magical girls are just walking corpses, Kyubey is basically the devil who collects human's souls and disguising it as doing the universe some good, and Homura is a hopeless lesbian time traveler. It blows over your face that you should not judge a pizza by its toppings, or whatever the fuck they all say. Suddenly, it's about how ultimate purity and goodness doesn't really exist in a universe that is ran by balance of hope and despair. And that, there is always an all-powerful floating pink-haired lesbian god who contains dark energy, displaces it somewhere else, and maintains the balance, for all eternity. She is neither sentient nor human anymore, but now just an omniscient omnipotent being, who may or may not exist anymore, if not for Homura, her lover (AniList.co says it's canon based on the tags). And it's all for her, and ***for every woman in the world***. While Homura's plan backfired when she tried to go back in time over and over again, to reverse Madoka's fate, to
protect her, it only led to Madoka receiving all the other universe's Madoka's karmic/cosmic potential, turning her into the most powerful being, even more powerful than Kyubey itself. BUT, I don't think Homura's actions were a mistake. In fact, it was their destiny all along. Sure, there was never a single happy ending for everyone involved, especially for the two of them, they never lived together or grew up together, what happened was a cosmic dream realized by just the two of them alone. And THAT is a sapphic love story I'm all here for. Definitely one the best (canonically) fantasy existential magical girl Yuri I've ever watched. Yes, even better than NanoFate (I haven't even watched that anime lol). 

I was a little bit thrown off by the art style of Madoka but in the end, it didn't even matter at all. It threw me off so bad, it just sat on my watchlist for an entire decade. My bad, yuri lovers. All my life I've been trying to find a fantasy tragic Yuri anime just like *Kanazuki no Mikko* — it's just right here. In a magical girl anime disguise with a heavily shoujo cutesy artstyle. NEVER JUDGE A PEANUT BY ITS SHAPE!

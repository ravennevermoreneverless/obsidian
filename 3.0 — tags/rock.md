## 1940s to 1950s : BIRTH OF ROCK AND ROLL
— foundations came from the US during the late 1940s and early 1950s
— origins were melded from black musical genres back then, like rhythm and blues, gospel music and country/western music

- ***Rock Around the Clock*** (1954) — *Bill Haley* : first rock and roll track to enter the billboard's main sales and opened the world to this genre 

— There was a decline in the rock genre by 1959, with the death of Buddy Holly, departure of Elvis Presley to the army, retirement of Little Richard, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. 

— spread out from the US though associating the 'americanization' events happening worldwide resulted from the second world war 

- ***Move It*** (1959) — *Cliff Richard* : ushered in the sound of British rock.
- ***Wild One*** (1958) — *John O'Keefe* : was one of the earliest Australian rock and roll hits. 
- ***Rock Island Line*** (1955) — *Lonnie Donegan* : was a major influence and helped to develop and form a unique sound of small bands who play Rock and Roll like John Lennon's Quarrymen (later on The Beatles). 

— former rock and roll acts in the US became lightweight pop and ballads, the ones in the UK, more strongly influenced by blues-rock pioneers, developed rock music with their own touch and passion, another level of intensity, which will shape the future of rock music through the *British invasion*
## 1960s : British invasion and broadening sound
— the first 4 years of 1960s was a hiatus for rock and roll
— in this era, the genre is dominated by black and female artists
— instrumental rock became surf rock which became pop music at the time
- ***Surfin'*** (1961) — *The Beach Boys* : reached Billboard top 100 and helped solidify the surf music craze 
— by the end of 1962, british rock scene started with these bands: *The Beatles*, *Gerry & The Pacemakers*, *The Searchers*, *Freddie and the Dreamers*, *Herman's Hermits*, and *The Hollies*. 
— they all combined US forms of music (from before) and added high energy, more aggressive, type of beat — often adapting an anti-establishment stance
- ***I Want to Hold Your Hand*** — *The Beatles* : was their first number one hit on the Billboard top 100
— they became the biggest selling rock band of all time and immediately followed by these British acts: *Peter and Gordon*, *The Animals*, *Manfred Mann*, *Petula Clark*, *Wayne Fontana*, *The Mindbenders*, *The Rolling Stones*, *The Troggs*, *Donovan*, *The Kinks*, *The Who*, *The Dave Clark Five*. 
— these bands helped internationalize the production of rock and roll, ending the era of US-based surf music, vocal girl groups, and teen idols, as well as established R&B acts
- ***Rubber Soul*** — *The Beatles* : followed by :
- ***Aftermath*** — *The Rolling Stones*
- ***Revolver*** — *The Beatles*
- ***A Quick One*** — *The Who*
- ***Pet Sounds*** — *The Beach Boys* (US-based)
- ***Blonde on Blonde*** — *Bob Dylan* (US-based)
### Blues Rock

 — the second wave of bands drew inspiration directly from American blues (some examples would be *The Rolling Stones* and *The Yardbirds*) 
 — the acoustic playing of *Lead Belly* and *Robert Johnson* have been huge influences with the Skiffle craze and among British blues musicians in the late 1950s and early 1960s. — after the tour of ***Britain*** by *Muddy Waters* in 1958 and the influence of the Chicago blues, it prompted two young men to form a band called *Blues Incorporated*. 
 — this particular band inspired many of the British blues bands, like members of *The Rolling Stones* ans *Cream*, combining blues standards with rock instrumentations 
— John Mayall formed *Bluesbreakers*, along with Eric Clapton (after he left *The Yardbirds*) and then Peter Green
- ***Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano)*** (1966) : considered one of the seminal British blues recordings which sound emulated in both British and United States
— Eric Clapton created *Cream*, *Blind Faith*, *Derek and the Dominos*, then a successful
solo career
— Peter Green, the *Bluesbreakers*' rhythm sections Mick Fleetwood and John McVie formed *Fleetwood Mac*
— Jeff Beck, also part of *Yardbirds*, turned blues rock to heavy rock with his band, the *Jeff Beck Group*
— the last *Yardbirds* guitarist was Jimmy Page, who went on to form *The New Yardbirds*, which turned into *Led Zeppelin*, in which many of their first releases features expansions on traditional blues songs
— meanwhile in the US, *Lonnie Mack* pioneered blues rock in the early 1960s but the genre boomed in mid-1960s because of: *Paul Butterfield*, *Canned Heat*, *Jefferson Airplane*, *Janis Joplin*, *Johnny Winter*, the *J. Geils Band*, the *Jimi Hendrix Experience*, *Band of Gypsys*
— in the southern US states, *Allman Brothers Band*, *Lynyrd Skynyrd*, *ZZ Top* incorporated country elements to blues rock to produce Southern rock

— blues rock often emulated jazz, with long improvisations, which would later be an element of progressive rock. 
— from about 1967, bands like *Cream* and *Jimi Hendrix Experience* will leave blues-based music to psychedelia
— by 1970s, blues rock will become heavier and more riff-based, by the examples of *Led Zeppelin* and *Deep Purple*, wherein it blurs the line of blues rock and hard rock
— though the blues rock genre will be continued on by *George Thorogood* and *Pat Travers*, particularly in the British scene, the genre shifted into heavy metal, leaving blues rock totally behind the mainstream

### Garage Rock

— garage rock is kind of like a raw form of rock music, widespread in North America in the mid-1960s 
— the name is that way because it was said that the music sounds like it was rehearsed in a suburban family garage
— garage rock songs often revolved around the traumas of high school life, "lying girls" and unfair social circumstances
— the lyrics and delivery tend to be more aggressive, often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming
- ***Tall Cool One*** (1958) — *The Wailers* : early garage rock
- ***Louie Louie*** (1963 version) — *The Kingsmen* : mainstream example of the genre in its formative stages
by 1963, garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers, including *Paul Revere and the Raiders*, the *Trashmen*, the *Rivieras*, and the *Sonics*. 

— the British invasion greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience, leading many to adopt a British influence and encouraging more groups to form
— despite the number of garage bands being signed to major regional labels, most were commercial failures
— garage rock peaked commercially and artistically around 1966 and by 1968, the style largely fell off the national charts and the local level
### Folk rock

— in the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the american folk music revival had grown to a major movement, using traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments
— pioneered by *Woody Guthrie* and *Pete Seeger*
— *Joan Baez* and *Bob Dylan* started out as singer-songwriters and while they begin to influence each other, rock and folk music were still very much separated

— early attempts to combine elements of rock and folk:
- ***House of the Rising Sun*** (1964) — *Animals* : first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation
- ***I'm a Loser*** (1964) — *The Beatles* : the first Beatles song to be influenced directly by Dylan
- ***Mr. Tambourine Man*** (1965) — *The Byrds* : folk rock movement took off with this recording of Dylan's
- ***Like a Rolling Stone*** (1965) — *Bob Dylan* : US hit single which enraged folk fans because Dylan adopted electric instruments

— folk rock particularly took off in California, where it led acts like:
- *The Mamas & The Papas*, *Crosby, Stills, and Nash*
- in New York spawned: *The Lovin' Spoonful*, *Simon and Garfunkel*'s ***The Sounds of Silence*** (1965) : being remixed with rock instruments to be the first of many hits
— these acts directly influenced british performers like *Donovan* and *Fairport Convention*; which later ditched American covers to play traditional English folk music on electric instruments
— British folk-rock music was now taken up by bands like:
- *Pentangle*
- *Steeleye Span*
- *The Albion Band*
— which in turn prompted Irish groups like *Horslips*
— Scottish acts like *JSD Band*, *Spencer's Feat*

— folk-rock reached its peak of commercial popularity during 1967-1968 before many acts moved on to different genres, like the Byrds and Dylan who went off to country rock instead
— the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influnce on the development of rock, bringing in elements of psychedelia, and helping to develop the ideas of the singer-songwriter, the protest song, and concepts of "authenticity"
### Psychedelic rock
— people started getting inspired by LSD and so they made music fuele by it. 
— *The 13th Floor Elevators* from Texas, the first band to introduce themselves as psychedelic rock
— this genre took off mainly in California, influenced by The Beatles' instrumentations and The Byrds' shift from folk to folk rock in 1965
— the psychedelic lifestyle, which includes hallucinogenic drug intake is already rampant in San Francisco and the bi-products of those were *Big Brother and the Holding Company*, *The Grateful Dead* and *Jefferson Airplane*. 
— Jimi Hendrix's distorted, feedback-filled jams became a key feature in psychedelia. 
- ***Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band*** — *The Beatles* (starting point for the album era, rock transitioned from singles to albums and achieved cultural legitimacy in the mainstream)
- ***Their Satanic Majesties Request*** — *The Rolling Stones*
- ***The Piper at the Gates of Dawn*** — *Pink Floyd*
- ***Surrealistic Pillow*** — *Jefferson Airplane* 
- ***The Doors*** — *The Doors*

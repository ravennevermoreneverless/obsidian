I used to watch this regularly whenever I'm losing faith in humanity again. Any song can bring people together, honestly. And to see 1000 or more people bond over a single song and perform unitedly? It gives me so much goosebumps, and how it's such a testament of people coming together in the name of music. Art will bring world peace. Art will save the earth.

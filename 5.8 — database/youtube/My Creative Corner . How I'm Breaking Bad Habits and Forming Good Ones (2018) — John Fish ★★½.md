caption: Do you want to break bad habits and form good ones? In this video, I talk about how I rearranged my environment (and specifically created a Creative Corner) so that I could change my behavior a little easier. If you want to create new, good habits, try it out. If you want to get rid of old, bad habits, try it out. Changing your environment has the potential to change your behavior.

He's right. Changing your environment makes your behaviors all the more malleable and you can shape it to however you want; especilly the good habits.

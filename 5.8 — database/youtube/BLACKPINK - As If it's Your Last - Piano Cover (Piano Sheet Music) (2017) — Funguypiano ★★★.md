Not to get too technical (because I have no idea how in a musical sense), this instruments cover diverged to what *staying-true-to-its-source* is really like but maintained the *brought-justice-to-the-original* shit going on. Funguypiano made it his own goddamn piece and I'm all here for it. Makes me think about how certain musician's just need a foundation to build upon and then create their own grand finale.

Performing this at a building parking lot adds so much more to the heavenly effect that Alejandro may or may not be aiming for. It's like his voice is slowly and progressively ascending, lifting me and the others listening to this, onto a different planar existence that no one's ever been before. It's surreal. It's just his voice and his insane guitar playing but shit, it's the whole orchestra.

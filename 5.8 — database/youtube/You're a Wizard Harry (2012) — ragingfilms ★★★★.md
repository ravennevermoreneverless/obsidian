This is still one of the funniest videos I've ever watched. If they ask me what's my sense of humor, this is the very first thing I'd show. My older brother and I used to bond over this back in 2018. I also used to call this my religion lol. It's hilarious how they progressively become more Scottish the angrier they get. And how they argue in a sort of decrepit part of England where drunkards, hobos, and drug addicts reside in — the ghetto of England. ***Harry Potter*** on crack.

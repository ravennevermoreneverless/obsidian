caption: "If humans want to expand into space, it will take us incredible amounts of energy. How do we do that? Easy: we will just use the sun’s energy by realizing the most ambitious construction project in history. This is how it works."

For interstellar civilization advancement, we need a fuckton of energy. Where most to look on than in our solar system; the sun. And how do we capture that massive amounts of energy? Building a ***Dyson Sphere***, a megastructure capable of harnessing a star's massive mounts of power output. The best way to build this structure is not with a rigid foundation, but with a *swarm*. Building it won't be easy though. We'd need around some quadrillion units, some quintillion tons of materials, and a planet we can do our operations at. We can sort the how-tos into three parts: (1) materials, (2) design, (3) energy. Firstly, we need lots of materials. Mercury is very metal-rich, has a thin atmosphere which makes it easier to launch things to space, and it's closer to the sun — which makes it a perfect candidate for our project. Second, we need a simple design. We need them cheap, easy to produce, and lightweight. Lastly, the amount of energy we need to build a dyson sphere is almost equal the amount of energy we'd harness from the star itself. But there's plenty of sunlight in Mercury. This needs manpower, so we have to automate and make robots. To launch the swarm to space, we don't need rockets. We need a railgun, a long electromagnetic tube which shoots the swarm in light speed towards the direcrion of the sun. We can take advantage of the concept of exponential growth. The more we build and launch units, the greater the energy we can harness, the more units we can build and launch, and so on. If a square kilometer of swarm can be done in a month, we can be done in a decade. If only our planet can keep up with the growing amount of energy. Even just 1% of the sun's energy can be a terrifyingly advanced development for our civilization. We'd have unlimited amounts of energy, a key to interstellar progress of our kind!

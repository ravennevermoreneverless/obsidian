## REVIEW

kato's completely useless to be honest lol. it's interesting that they chose the "finding out there are other gantz teams kurono kei-less" arc (apparently called nurarihyon alien mission arc i just searched) and have kato as the main character for this adaptation, consideing how much the manga really focuses on kei being the protagonist. i thought they settled for kato and kei not knowing each other but i'm glad they gave this one a subtle twist by the end, which is a little accurate. i don't really remember how kei was killed in the manga and before watching this, i was kind of hoping kei's the protagonist even though i didn't really like his hormonal ass. anyway, i was expecting kaze, sakurai, and takeshi to have their own scenes but i guess they settled with just reika, the old man, nishi, and that one girl from osaka team who existed for like 5 chapters. really, i was expecting the film to be longer and to be more than just one game but to be fair, gantz has 383 chapters and the first few arcs can be boring and the last few arcs are a disaster with how they managed squeezing the end-of-the-world shit along with explaining where gantz came from and what it really is—so i get how they chose this arc more than the rest (although i was hoping they choose to animate the alien invasion arcs but i guess that would be too much considering how overblown the details were on those chapters). i'm also pleasantly surprised with how much work they put onto this adaptation just to make it stand on its own while at the same time staying true to the original source. the graphics and animation are so amazing, i really liked the 3d feel to it. they did the fight scenes nicely as well as the design of the monsters. gantz is something that i learned to love as i read it for the past few months and seeing something this amazing dedicated to the franchise feels me with pride. well done.

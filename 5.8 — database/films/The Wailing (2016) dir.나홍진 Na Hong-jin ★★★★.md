"***why does the devil punish sinners in hell?***"

i ask myself this question after the film. and honestly? it's a good thought to have, which would explain the devil's motive towards the village. he punishes the victims/villagers (by cursing them, possessing them to kill their loved ones) after they sinned (rampant racism, among all else — violence is another thing), not to bring justice, banish evil completely and to bring forth goodness in everyone, but to feed more on the domino-effect of their soul's sufferings — ***pure evil***. the guardian spirit/goddess of the village (woman in white) prevents the devil from doing its deed and tries to save everyone — as she embodies ***pure goodness*** — and yet was still weakened and eventually failed in the end. as the film showcases different sets of beliefs and the questioning of one's faith, it also expounds on the idea that this division of faith and race, not only drives them further away from the truth they're seeking, it also invites more evil to be cast. 

a great film, btw. a rewatch is definitely something you need to do if you didn't understand it at first.

the song opens up with a simple trumpet melody, that repeats until the start of the first verse, accompanied by a drum-march type of percussion, which started out with some pretty interesting lyrics: "*i have this dream that i am hitting my dad with a baseball bat and he is screaming and crying for help. and maybe halfway through, it has more to do with me killing him than it ever did protecting myself* which represents how abusive the singer's father is and how it haunts him even in his dreams. his violence was fueled by hatred as he bludgeons his dad with a baseball bat more so in an attenpt to kill him than pure self-defense as his father might be physically abusive. his father has made a lot of mistakes, and even though no one is perfect, he never attempts to better himself, and keeps on making the same mistakes. "*it just sucks it played out like this, a terrible movie, and you can tell none of the actors even give a fuck*" signifies the singer's life is one big mess of a film, and that all the actors, the people in his life, just don't care about acting or doing their job as a fulfilling role in the motion picture. no one cares about him, and this adds up to how miserable his life is. the bridge and chorus suddenly shifts to his current girlfriend, in which he only sees her as an escape from his terribly cruel life, rather than loving her for who she is. he describes his girlfriend as highschool, an easy thing to handle, and he was more like real life, harsh and cruel in all ways reality is. "*i'll do the push-ups, i'll wear the makeup, i'll do whatever he wants all night*" means he does everything his dad wants, or everything his dad wants him to be, just so the abuse could possibly stop because he had already pleased him somehow. the second verse starts out with another series of interesting lyrics: "*a long, long time ago my great-great-great-great-grandfather took something that did not belong to him. and that is why today i have an eagle in my veins, i am part native american*" talks about how an ancestor of him has raped a native american woman and passed the lineage to their descendants, including the singer. then talks about his girlfriend again and how she would probably leave him once her sexual desires have been fulfilled, meaning she doesn't care about him, too, in a deeper level. "*i hope i fall asleep at the wheel and crash my car on the ride home*" means he doesn't care if his life gets in danger, even death, if it means he won't get to go home to his abusive father and his bitter reality. there might be a suicidal connotation here somewhere. the bridge and chorus repeats, and by this time, you certainly would've noticed the enough amount of cowbells in the song.

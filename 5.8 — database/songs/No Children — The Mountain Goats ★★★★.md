a song about love turning into contempt and pure hatred towards a significant other, yet staying in the relationship just out of bitter spite. the way it was sang is perfectly suited for how angry the singer is, like if we're going down, we're BOTH going down, because we deserve it. with just the accompaniment of a mad strumming of an acoustic guitar and the heavy slams of piano riffs, this song is just made exquisitely and specifically for a really toxic relationship. i've read somewhere that the lyrics seem like a ramblings of a husband whose friend told them to "have hope" for the relationship and as a sardonic response, he hopes for a lot of things; mainly the downfall of the relationship and for everything to get even worse, even wishing for the worst to not be over. most of their mutual friends have left them already because they're destroying their lives and is at risk at harming others around them. and yet, in the lyrics "*in my life, i hope i lie. and tell everyone you were a good wife*" the singer still has a shred of loyalty for the woman, but i doubt it's because he still loves her. maybe he does, but they're too far gone to even fix anything. the second verse has some lyrics that would seem like hoping for mere inconveniences to happen to the other person or to the singer, but it's all out of spite. as if he's hoping they'd both have a bad day, everyday; "*i hope i cut myself shaving tomorrow, i hope it bleeds all day long*" and "*and i hope you blink before i do*". then the lyrics "*i hope i never get sober*" which could largely hint at the singer being an alcoholicâ€”drinking seems to be a way of escape from his current marriage. but by far my favorite lyrics would be "*i hope you die, i hope we both die*" because it's the ultimate end to whatever kind of shithole they both ended up in. they're both miserable, they both hate each other, the best outcome for this will be death, kind of like a twisted marriage vow (probably a divorce vow). we're signing the divorce papers with this one.

>I hope that our few remaining friends
>Give up on trying to save us
>I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
>To piss off the dumb few that forgave us

>I hope the fences we mended
>Fall down beneath their own weight
>And I hope we hang on past the last exit
>I hope it's already too late

>And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
>Someday burns down
>And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
>And I never come back to this town again

>In my life, I hope I lie
>And tell everyone you were a good wife
>And I hope you die
>I hope we both die

>I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
>I hope it bleeds all day long
>Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
>We're pretty sure they're all wrong

>==I hope it stays dark forever==
>==I hope the worst isn't over==
>==And I hope you blink before I do==
>==I hope I never get sober==

>==And I hope when you think of me years down the line==
>==You can't find one good thing to say==
>==And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out==
>==You'd stay the hell out of my way==

>I am drowning
>There is no sign of land
>You are coming down with me
>Hand in unlovable hand

>And I hope you die
>I hope we both die

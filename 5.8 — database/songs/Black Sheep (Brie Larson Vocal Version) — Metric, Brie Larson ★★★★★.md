brie larson's voice is very chic and pairs well with the song as it makes it a bit more modernized. it's not very loud and aggressive, or even powerful, but it has a certain kind of sophistication which makes it more pleasant to listen to the more you listen to the song. the song itself is already addictive—it has catchy lyrics and melody, not pop-wise, but something that is easy to follow and sing along to; something to sing out loud in a shower or at a karaoke. not very rock-ish to have a bit of a head bang session, but rock enough to have a tasteful serving of slamming electric guitars as it mostly does down strokes and steady drum sequences that doesn't stray further from the script. the pre-chorus kind of does this "tip-toeing" with the syllables which plays well for a chorus build-up. during the post-chorus(es), the melody dives into a kind of bittersweet feeling of reminiscences, accompanied by a "we won, at long last, but it's the end" type of guitar riffs. there's an entire 1 minute and 17 seconds section by the end of the song without any vocals and i feel like it just solidifies that nostalgic feeling this song evokes as the song fades into a gentle end with only guitar static for the last 26 seconds. adding the "*oh yeah?*"s at the beginning brings more justice to the actual scene in the scott pilgrim film. easily the best song in the film, i don't think i'll get tired of listening to this.

> Black sheep, come home (15x)

> Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when
> Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
> Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
> You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again

> I'll send you my love on a wire
> Lift you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh
> From you

> Got balls of steel, got an automobile, for a minimum wage
> Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outer space
> Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
> You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again

> ==I'll send you my love on a wire==
> ==Lift you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh==
> ==It's a mechanical bull, the number one==
> ==You'll take a ride from anyone==
> ==Everyone wants a ride, pulls away, ooh, from you==

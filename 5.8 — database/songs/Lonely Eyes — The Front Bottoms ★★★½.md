the lyrics are as straightforward as it gets. a guy with low self-esteem clings towards the idea of a "lonely girl", wanting to be with her, because he is lonely himself. he wants to be the savior of this lonely girl when in truth, he's the one who needs saving. it might also imply that the girl isn't actually lonely and pathetic as he paints her to be, but he only builds upon that idea, just so he can feel like the knight in shining armor for her. the lyrics "*and if you need a little sunshine you can borrow some of mine. it's okay if you're unhappy. i would say before i leave her. *just take a look around there's no one here who's happy either*" in the song paints this quotes as the guy uplifts the girl's low moods. but i think it's more of an encouragement for himself, words he wants to hear from the people around him. he projects his lonely self to the idealization of a lonely girl.

>You got me stuck to where I'm sittin', lookin' at your eyes
>And I know I'm so pathetic, I wouldn't move to save my life
>And they tell me that you're lonely, it's no surprise
>When you walk around all day wearing those lonely, lonely
>Lonely eyes

>Well, I try to tell you jokes, I'm afraid you'd cry
>And if you need a little sunshine, you could borrow some of mine
>"It's okay if you're unhappy," I would say before I leave her
>"Just take a look around, there's no one here that's happy either"

>==Lonely girl, you are my world==
>==And I could be anything you need==
>==And if for some reason, you don't feel like talkin'==
>==I could just sit and enjoy your company==
>==Your company==

>Well, the days keep going by, and it doesn't get much better
>You could be threatening to jump, and all your friends would just scream, "Let her!"
>They count on you to leave 'cause it's always been that way
>But on the one day they close early, that's the one you want to stay

>Lonely girl, you are my world
>And I could be anything you need
>And if for some reason, you don't feel like talking
>I could just sit and enjoy your company
>Your company


>Lonely girl, you are my world
>And I could be anything you need
>And if for some reason, you don't feel like talkin'
>I could just sit and enjoy your company
>Lonely girl, you are my world
>And I could be anything you need
>And if for some reason, you don't feel like talking
>I could just sit and enjoy your company
>Your company

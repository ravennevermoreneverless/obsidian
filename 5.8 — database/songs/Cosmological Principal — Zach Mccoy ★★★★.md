the cosmological principle states that no matter where we look in the universe, we still see the same distribution of objects. the universe looks the same whoever and wherever we are. if you ask "where is the center of the universe?", the answer would be "everywhere". we're on the surface of a balloon getting blown up, as in the lyrics "*well this balloon keeps getting bigger*" and yet we're mere dots on the surface of the balloon. if we make objects of the universe dots and we want to find out the center of the universe's expansion, we can set a certain percent of expansion on two frames of reference in time; the past and present, and if we line up one point in the past to its corresponding point in the present, it will always appear as the center of the universe; "*'cause i'm the center of you and you're the center of me*" even at the very end of time, no matter how far the universe has expanded "*when the flame goes out, when the oceans pack their things and they leave*" the cosmological principle will remain; anything can be the center because the laws of physics is the same everywhere—it is isotropic and homogeneous. this song gives us a kind of existential sentimentalism; how insignificant yet significant we are at the same time, in the face of the vast cosmos. a kind of universal longing for another, that no matter what happens, everything will be alright in the end.

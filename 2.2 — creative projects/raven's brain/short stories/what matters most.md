*What is love?*

A very overrated question that has been asked so many times and yet we never end up with a final definition. We all have different ways of defining The love. You can go on the streets, ask random 1
Love is..LOVE.

You can even define love with a straight out definition from a dictionary. But Lauren thinks otherwise. But what is love to Lauren? It's not that simple. Especially for a logical thinking person like her.

'*One does not simply define love,*' she says in her mind as she stares at the white ceiling of her room. She can see the faded cobwebs on the corners and crevices of the wall and the ceiling. The amount of work she has isn't letting her clean her room for a while. '*Maybe love is like this ceiling. It's high up, it's unreachable..unless you use portable stairs, that is.*'

Lauren chuckles to herself. She was never fond of those cliché, cheesy quotes of what love is. Those types of poetry she sees on Tumblr and those icky love quotes made into wallpapers on Google. Pictures of couples kissing on a sunset as backgrounds..cringe. She didn't really have a sweet side, it's kind of non-existent. She'd sell her soul first before she can be cheesy. Nu-uh. '*I guess I'll just settle for a dictionary definition if I'm asked about it.*'

"What's so funny?"

An airy but sweet voice halted her train of thoughts. Lauren turned her attention to the voice that she is most familiar with. A skinny (in a good and sexy way) long-legged brunette sat on a fluffy bean bag beside the bed, book on hand. The girl is donned in Lauren's old but cozy band sweatshirt that has been worn a hundred times paired with white sinful shorts. The girl wasn't even a fan of the band, actually. But she liked their song that kinda goes like: *Bite your face to spite your nose. Seventeen and a half years old.*

Anyways, Lauren almost forgot she had company.

The brunette is looking at Lauren curiously with a cute smile, she couldn't help a similar face forming on her face. She could stare at that smile all day long. Or she could kiss that smile off her face. Whichever she prefer. Her smile just widened at the thought. She didn't even acknowledge the question.

The adorable smile from the brunette turned into a playful smirk. "Were you thinking about me?"

Lauren blinked.

"W-what? Pfft, of course not."

"Riiiight," the girl got up from the bean bag graciously, placed the book on the bedside table and slowly made her way to Lauren. "You were, weren't you?"

Before Lauren could respond, the other girl tackled her on the bed, straddled her and tickled her sides, "Admit it!"

"W-wait! C-camz! Stop it--haha Camila! Cut it out!" Lauren squirmed under and wiggled like a worm under her, trying to get out the girl's hold but she couldn't move from all the tickling she's receiving and the uncontrollable laughter she lets out. But when she found an opportunity, she grabbed the younger girl's wrists and turned their positions around. She is now on top of her attacker. "I hope you didn't forget I'm stronger than you."

They were both panting, just staring at each other's eyes. Getting lost in the sea of their own world, communicating through the waves of their gazes. They didn't even notice Lauren's phone sliding and falling from the bed to the floor.

The older girl leaned down carefully, never breaking their eye contact. She tucked a lose strand of hair from the younger girl behind her ear, their lips merely inches apart. She broke their silent talking with a delicate whisper, "And fine. I admit it. I was thinking about you. Kissing you." Her breath hit Camila's lips for a second until she placed her lips on hers softy.

Lauren didn't mind the cold soft lips pressed to her own. Because it was everything.

At times like this, Lauren thinks she knows what love really is. It's just her and Camila, together.

And it's all that matters.

Lauren never understood why she is making two cups of steaming hot chocolate in the middle of May. It's summer, for goodness' sake. She blames a certain bubbly girl with those stupid adorable puppy eyes, begging for satisfaction of her cravings. And Lauren couldn't just say no to those eyes. '*I want 6 marshmallows in mine! Love ya!*' Camila's voice echoed in her mind. '*You make one for yourself, too!*' And thus, she obliged. Why you ask? Well, she's not whipped, obviously.

The raven-haired girl shook her head with a smile. Who was she kidding? She'd do everything for Camila.

Footsteps echoed through the hallway and stopped in front of the kitchen door. A tall Polynesian girl stood, hands on her hips. "Mani's craving for some ice cream from that ice cream parlor we went to last Saturday. Swear, I think she's on her period."

"Am not!" Normani appeared behind the taller girl with a slightly offended face. Dinah just rolled her eyes at the girl and sighed, "Anyway, we're gonna go out and buy some right now. Which flavor you want?"

Before Lauren could answer, the two girls looked questioningly at the two cups of hot chocolate the Latina was preparing. Lauren chuckled, "Don't even ask."

"I want some of those cookie dough flavor I always get. I put dibs on the coffee one as an alternative." She stopped stirring one of the chocolate liquid and said, "Oh, and a tub of mint chocolate chip. Camila wouldn't want to miss an ice cream opportunity."

Dinah froze for a second. "Lauren.." She glanced worriedly at Normani. The two exchanged looks with unreadable expressions. Normani just shook her head and sighed. "Let's just go and buy them what they want," she said as she turned on her heels and walk away. "Later, Lo." 

Dinah followed shortly after, but not without casting Lauren a lingering look. It's the similar look Ally gave her that time her puppy died and she didn't wanna talk about it. And that time she lost the tickets for her and Camila for the movie she badly wanted to see.

"What's up with them?" she mumbled whilst placing the marshmallows on Camila's hot chocolate, remembering the specific count of the puffy treats.

'*Maybe they're both on their periods.*' She shrugged as he balanced the cups each on her hand, careful not to spill on the recently polished floor (she vaguely hears Dinah saying '*Don't you dare spill on my Poly-shed floor*.'). Her mind drifted to the girl of her dreams inside her room who is waiting for the hot chocolate she craves.

Later that day, she didn't even mind that Camila never even took a sip of her hot chocolate and that Lauren ended up drinking both. Maybe she was too preoccupied with the cheap new fairy lights Lauren bought from Amazon earlier that week. So, she didn't mind.

She only smiled. She is happy because Camila is happy.

And it's all that matters again.

Lauren can't remember the last time she went outside since the start of Summer. It's just too hot outside that she couldn't bring herself to take a step past the door of their apartment. It's not only because her skin is almost as sensitive as a vampire's skin (she swears sometimes she thinks she came from a vampire bloodline), it's also because she's too lazy to move with all the heat the sun is producing.

Now, why was she walking aimlessly on the city's sidewalk in the middle of the day? She didn't know. The last thing she remembers is that she was reading this pretty interesting book about frogs and toads laying eggs then the next thing she knows, she's being dragged by this annoyingly cute and enthusiastic girlfriend outside saying, '*You need more vitamin sun, Lauren! You're too pale!*' '*It's vitamin D, Camz*.' '*Oh shush, it's the same thing*.'

An excited gasp suddenly came from the said enthusiastic girlfriend. "Look, Lo! It's so adorable!", she exclaimed as she pointed to the little Corgi puppy being walked by a grouchy teenager who looks like she'd rather be inside the refrigerator than under the scorching heat. "It looks just like you."

"Yeah, she does. It's pretty accurate."

Camila slapped the older girl's arm with her free hand lightly. "I meant the puppy, you dummy."

"Oh." Lauren shrugged. She gently tightened her hold on the girl's hand as she stared at the younger girl, who was staring at the puppy dreamily.

"Let's go to it." Camila suddenly said. And then the next thing Lauren knew again, is she's being dragged, again. They briskly walked to the dog and the owner, their intertwined hands never letting go. They stopped in front of the dog, Camila leaning down to the puppy and cooed,"Aww, Lo, it's so cuuuute!". But the puppy's attention was on Lauren's legs, sniffing on it. Lauren's just standing there awkwardly, the teenager just looking at her weirdly.

"What's his name?" Camila turned to the young girl. The teenager was just awkwardly standing there, giving Lauren weird looks. Lauren kinda got irritated for the girl just ignored Camila's question. "She just asked what's the name of the dog.", she repeated, annoyed.

"O-oh, um, Becca. Named after my aunt.", the girl stuttered, threatened by Lauren's annoyed scowl. "Uhm, I gotta go now." With that, the teen abruptly turned around the other direction and walked away with the puppy following. The girl kept glancing back to them as she walked.

"What's up with her?" Camila asked, confused. Lauren just shrugged and tugged on Camila's hands. "Come on." '*The nerve of that girl ignoring Camila as if she isn't there.*'

Forgetting the previous awkward exchange, Camila turned to her and said, "Hey, Lo, if we ever moved in to our own house I want a puppy like that running around, you hear me?"

And Lauren knew she'll spend the rest of her life with this girl beside her.

A sudden burst of excitement and butterflies made her lean forward and kiss Camila passionately, as if her life depended on it. As if she can convey all her emotions and feelings in that one kiss. The younger Latina was caught off guard but kissed back. "As you wish," Lauren mumbled on her lips as she pulled back.

The flames of passion and love in her eyes were overwhelming; it almost hurt. It almost made her snap back to reality. It almost reminded her this moment was too good to even be real.

But Camila beat her to it and pecked her gently on the lips again, maybe a gesture of gratitude. And everything's well again.

"Lauren! Let's go to the grocery store! I'm in the mood for some pranking."

Lauren almost slip out a complaint about the store being a 30-minute walk from where they are but as she laid eyes on the overly enthusiastic look on her girl, she stopped herself and just smiled gently at her.

The grin on Camila's face widened and her grip on Lauren's hand tightened as she led the way, swinging their hands back and forth.

'*It isn't so bad being outside, after all*.' Lauren silently thinks. She felt light and she felt like flying; she felt as if everything didn't matter to her as long as this girl is by her side.

As soon as she sensed the vibrant light coming from the girl beside her, as soon as she caught sight of the happy and content smile on the girl's face, as soon as she felt the cold but pleasant hand wrapped around hers; she forgot all about the lines of frustration in her mind. She was able to tolerate the sun's glares and the sweat trickling down her neck and her white shirt sticking disgustingly on her backside.

She even ignored the people's baffled looks and the staring as if they grew two heads. '*What a bunch of homophobes. They still exist wherever you go*.'

But she doesn't care. She's with Camila and she's happy.

And it's all that matters yet again.

--

Two girls cuddled under the warm comforts of a blanket on the bed. They just finished re-watching one of Camila's favorite movies. A comfortable silence filled the room and they were both contently wrapped around each other's arms. 

"One day, I'll take you to Japan." Lauren said out of nowhere, breaking the silence.

"Hmm, why Japan?" Camila mumbled, her face buried on Lauren's neck, placing soft kisses.

The older girl closes her eyes as she savors Camila's kisses along her neck and jawline. She tightened her arm that is wrapped around the younger girl's shoulders. "I don't know, it's just such a cool place. There's sushi there, and I want to see the Sakura trees. It's pretty clean there and super awesome." She briefly looked at Camila. "Don't you think?"

Camila lifted her head up to face Lauren, breathing out a small sigh as she slowly sat up.

"Don't you think so? Like we'll go backpacking through Tokyo, ride the bullet trains and visit shrines," she continued talking, "It'll be awesome, babe."

Camila only smiled at her, but the smile didn't quite reach her eyes. Lauren almost swore it was a sad smile. She immediately sat up, mirroring Camila's sitting position. "Camz? What's wrong?"

Camila didn't say anything and just pulled her back into their previous cuddling position, leaning in to Lauren's embrace. They were both quiet for a while but the worry in Lauren's mind hadn't left yet. Something was wrong.

"Lauren.."the airy but sweet voice broke the silence. The voice was so soft and gentle Lauren almost thought it came from her mind, "how much do you love me?"

She didn't expect that question out of the blue. And she didn't expect the solemn tone of her girlfriend's voice when she asked that question.

And she was back to that question again because it was almost the same. What is love? The question rang at the back of her mind like her mother's voice reminding her to close the lid of the toilet whenever she finishes using the bathroom. It rang at the back of her mind like her alarm clock every morning whenever she wakes up to a dreadful Monday ahead of her. How much do you love me?

She turned to the girl of her dreams.

Camila. Camila Cabello. Camila is her hot chocolate in the middle of summer. Camila is her passionate kiss on the sidewalk under the sun. Camila is her warm blanket drapes around her body during cold nights. Camila is her distraction to her endless worries and Camila is the sweet voice reminding her that love is this. This is love.

Words couldn't measure how much she loves the girl. She couldn't quite form words and sentences to describe how it feels. Even in her extremely high verbal ability, she couldn't dig the right expressions in the deepest parts of her inner vocabulary. It's like an explosion of complicated verbal formations in her mind, a scrambled mess of calculations on how she must convey her emotions through a coherent speech.

So, she went for the closest thing a typical Lauren Jauregui would do. She kissed her. It wasn't a kiss filled with lust and with the intention of making love. And it wasn't an innocent, spur-of-the-moment, short kiss. It was the kiss that contained her heart, her soul and her whole being. It contained both their worlds, the whole universe and the hope that Camila would share it with her because that's what she wants and all she ever wanted.

Lips moved against each other in a heated battled of feelings, like galaxies shifting and expanding into a wide range of multiple clusters of celestial dust and gases. Tongues sliding, both of them dominating yet seeking for an opportunity to become one with the other. It was like a star's titanic explosion, a supernova, that can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy of billions and billions of normal stars. Yet it was like a blackhole; an intense gravitational pull that not even particles and light can escape from with matter squeezed into one tiny space.

What Lauren failed to notice was her own tears trailing down her cheeks like heated razorblades cutting through her skin.

She failed to notice the chapped lips and smooth skin she was most familiar with yet they were all as cold as the night's breeze.

And she failed to notice the emptiness behind Camila's eyes, as if something was missing.

But to Lauren, at this exact moment, nothing really matters. She's with Camila. And Camila's with her.

It was everything and nothing at once.

And it's all that ever matters.

Dinah walked through the confines of the apartment, muttering under her breath. "I swear I'll pound whoever ate the last of my brownies."

She was furious. She had a bad day and those brownies were the only thing that can make her feel better but she was greeted with a plastic bag of leftover brownie crumbs. Normani and Ally aren't home so she resorted to the only person left inside the house; Lauren. She's got a lot of interrogating to do.

So she strutted until she was in front of Lauren's door. She was about to knock aggressively on the door when she heard a voice.

"Don't you think so? Like we'll go backpacking through Tokyo, ride the bullet trains and visit shrines," Lauren's muffled voice behind the door was heard. "It'll be awesome, babe."

'*Is she talking to someone on the phone? And babe?! She has a girlfriend? Maybe I should just talk to her later*.' The Polynesian girl wondered. She was about to turn around when she heard Lauren's raspy voice again.

"Camz? What's wrong?"

Dinah's breath was caught in her throat. '*It can't be.*'

She waited for a response. Anything. Anyone. Even though she knew it was impossible. She stood there like a statue, paralyzed and waiting. Her knees buckled and her eyes clouded with fogs of tears.

Her heart hurt, cracked open yet again for months now. But her heart broke more for her friend who has gone through so much.

After all, one's heart can only contain so much heartache when the one they loved and treasured the most has passed away; then the brain follows.

Dinah cupped a hand over her mouth to restrain soft broken sobs and small sniffles. So she turned and quietly walked away, not making any noise.

'*Camila is long gone and she's in a better place now*.'

She might be going crazy as well, but she almost swore she heard the airy but sweet voice of her dear lost friend breaking the loud painful silence, mentioning Lauren's name.

the walls are too crowded,
my eyes are painted black.
seven hundred years of longing,
but for sure i could come back.
shivering from the frost,
half a mile down the road.
not a soul has seen of this yet,
that's what i've been told.

i could see myself walking from a distance,
a silhouette of flashing lights and dark suburbia. 
the wounds are not even rupturing,
it's just suffering from hypothermia.
something's rotting in the corner,
i glance from left to right.
walls and rooms of endless nothing,
there's no end in sight.

now i'm scrubbing with my hands closed,
i'm too broken.
and as i lay here sleeping wired and wide-eyed,
i'm too far gone.
not even the disconnect from the connection,
i'm barely there.
screaming with my voice shut,
i'm swallowing too much air. 

we could say it again and again,
we're god knows who. 
but for sure the ghosts cry,
come split me in two. 
they say you can't see others suffering,
when you're suffering on your own.
but i'm seeing too much of everything,
and i'm feeling like a clone.

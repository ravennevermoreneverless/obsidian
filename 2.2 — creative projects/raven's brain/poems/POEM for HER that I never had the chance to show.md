I dedicate this poem to you.
It's hard trying to grasp the right words to say.
Even though words aren't enough to describe these bubbling emotions for you,
I'll try my best so hear me out:
You're a masterpiece, a work of art.
Every part of you are brush strokes from the hands of the finest artist,
painted with different array of colors.
Your body is a wonderland, sculpted by the god of gods.
Your voice is the music crafted by the heavens. 
Your smile paints the purple and orange skies of the sunset.
Your eyes hold the galaxies; infinite and vast.

You are my everything and anything.
You are the ray of sunshine that seeps through my window blinds in the morning. 
You are the bittersweet taste of coffee during Sunday afternoons.
You are the deep and bottomless ocean that I want to explore.
You are the vivid dream that I refuse to eake up from.
You are the fresh and chill breeze that caress my face at dusk.
You are the flower that blooms in the middle of a harsh winter season.
You are the angel that God sent to earth as a gift. 
You are the colorful rainbow that forms after a stormy day.
You are the sweater that warms my heart all day.
You are the pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down, I'm addicted.

I want to hear your voice, saying my name.
I want to understand how you think and feel.
I want to create new memories and experiences with you.
I want to know who means the world to you and inspires you.
I want so much to be there to love you when yo forget to love yourself.
I want you happy and smiling, bursting with happiness.
I want you when you feel sad you can't get out of bed.
I want you when it pours down with rain.
I want you when the sun decided to come
out.
I want you when the world ends.
I want you..
...but I can't.

Seeing you hurts me yet makes me happy all at the same time.
You're such a sweet torture, I'm never complaining.
Standing near you turns me into a nervous wreck, what are you doing to me?
Only ten feet away, I don't want you to see.
Looking at you, the world around me stops.
Everything's a slow motion, you're the focus of my attention. 
In the sea of people, I search for you.
I'm afraid to look at you for you'll catch me staring.
You make me feel things even though we haven't even spoke to each other.

I barely know you, I'm falling over you.
Maybe it's the way you do the things you do that make me fall in love with you.
It aches me that I haven't met you sooner, I wish I did.
Time is running out, I won't be seeing you anymore.
I just want you to know.. that you're the most beautiful being, inside and out, that I've ever seen.
You're perfectly imperfect and I couldn't get enough of you.
You're the flame that burns too bright for this world, you set my heart ablaze. 
Keep the fire burning.

You've been hurt far too many times,
by the people you think are "the one"
They don't deserve you.
You are extraordinary, 
fascinating,
divine,
beauteous,
and,
you deserve the world.

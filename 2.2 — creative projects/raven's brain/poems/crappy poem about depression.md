you'll never know what it feels like

until you lie down on the bed

with music mindlessly ringing in your ears

and you feel nothing

but it is eating you up inside

and you can actually feel the horrid wrenching,

tearing you apart on the inside

but you can do nothing about it.

you're contemplating

whether to keep going or just give up

you try to dig out happy memories in your past

but you realize it's becoming blurry and lesser

you're desperate tp crawl out of despair

but are you just fighting a war that's already lost from the start?

it's scary how much of an actress you are

all the lies are practiced

all the smiles and laughs are mastered

nobody seems to notice because you're perfect!

you're untouchable!

they see what they like to see

don't change that

don't show your true self, no.

your future is laid out upon you

and it's coming to an end

you realize you're all alone

your cries aren't heard

and so, the questions are unheard

you fall deaf from empty encouragements

and occasional "cheer up, it'll pass"

"you'll be happy, you'll get over it."

you don't seem to care anymore

of what's gonna happen next

because eventuall you'll know

you will fuck up everything again

what's there to hope for anyway?

nothing, nothing at all

you've got nothing left to lose

so patience, child, all's going to end soon.

await for that sweet lullaby,

whispering in your ears

that long overdue fate stated by the prophecies inside your head

the journey to a world full of dreams,

you're getting there

the fantasy you've beenhoping for since forever

driving through the road to eternal slumber.

now, please, if you're reading this

just ignore it, move along

for i've embraced the cold and being invisible for so long

don't worry, i've come to like it now

as the few remaining days ticked,

i say my final vow.

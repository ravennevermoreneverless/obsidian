artDescription: a yoko kanno soundtrack and a niche mappa series? duuuude, this kid has taste. i didn't have a full grasp of what this series was about when i watched it back in 2014 and it was fairly new then but i tried to rewatch it as an adult and i got goosebumps with how beautiful this anime is. i also did a reaaally good job with the colored pencils on this one. plus, the lines are more refined and with direction. clearly, i exerted effort with this piece and i'm happy!

growth: "[[adult]]"
title: hatsune mikuo & hatsune miku
artist: ravenowsky
dateCreated: "2012"
artDescription: of course, hatsune miku's genderbent counterpart, and their chibi forms. i used to have an obsession with genderbent things, especially fictional characters (for some reason). this might just be a hidden gender hints or awakenings that i was too young to figure out but even now, the reasons are still blurry. so i just drew hatsune mikuo :)

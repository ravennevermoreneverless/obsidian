artDescription: the umbrella scene could not even compare to the ampunt of gore shit i watch back then,,,, i had level 6 morbid curiosity as a kid and it was definitely not healthy. and i carried it to adulthood and now i'm a gore media enthusiast. not sure if it is part of any mental illness i have but it is what it is; a passion.

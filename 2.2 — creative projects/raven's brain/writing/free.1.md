# free#1

what is it, 
which makes me stay?

a glimmer of hope,
a promise of a future?
a touch of grass,
a fervent inevitable crash—

from the highs of motion 
and the caress of the clouds, i fly. 
still i stay. 

receive less than what i bargained for,
ultimately robbed 
yet here i am. 

there i was, where you are. 
a hologram of subtle sweetness,
straight from a movie scene—except not. 

you were there, i seized the moment,
then slipped away from my fingers,
mocking callously,
smiling greedily, i choke. 
would you be so kind to let me off? 

you graze, i ponder, i hope. 
i creep, i faze, you lurk.
i wish, you would, come back.

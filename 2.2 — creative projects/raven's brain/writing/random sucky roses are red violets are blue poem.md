# random sucky roses are red violets are blue poem 

roses are red, violets are blue
i love the way you smile; your voice and your adorableness, too

you shine so bright, brighter than the moon
i would say sun, but cliches won't make you swoon

you are unreachable, at first i didn't seem to mind
you were a star, but you became all the galaxies combined

i knew i couldn't touch you, why did i even try?
i was so enchanted by you, i desperately needed wings to fly

i tried to catch you, i was already at your tail
why did i even bother when i knew i was gonna fail?

so i looked up to you, i just stopped and smiled
you're so far up ahead and i'm so far behind

then i remembered what my grandfather has said to me
"if you admire a butterfly, oh sweety, just let it be."

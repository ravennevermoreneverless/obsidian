# song on the beach

footprints on cold sand,

under the unforgiving night sky constellations—

the night i won't forget.

we weren't on the same page,

we weren't hearing each other,

but i love you

and i thought that was fine.

heavy were the waves of the ocean,

a song on the beach,

you sipping on warm beer,

me with my camera and my beating heart,

the wind blowing on your face as you look back at me—

you were ethereal. 

and i love you;

at that moment,

in the depths of my being,

the waves were nothing but a ripple of water,

compared to what i feel for you.

  

nothing can ever ruin this.

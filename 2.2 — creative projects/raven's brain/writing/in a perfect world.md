# in a perfect world

in a perfect world, i would have returned your calls. in a perfect world, i wouldn't've let you cry yourself to sleep or even attempt to touch your shoulders while you wept. in a perfect world, i wouldn't feel as claustrophobic and i could say i love spending every moment with you. in a perfect world, i'd feel like myself completely with you.

# An itch

It starts out with an itch. It’s just right at the spot on your upper thigh, a soft warm buzzing feeling present around the area. You lift your hand and touch the tenderness of your skin; it’s strange, you can’t seem to scratch it, it’s almost like it lives under your skin. Nonetheless, you try to lightly scrape your fingers over it. Not enough. You press harder. And as if a ticking rupture that you accidentally triggered, it spreads. To the middle of your arm. The back of your hand. Your abdomen. The underside of your left scapula. Your fourth rib to the right. Your head, your entire face, wrapped around your neck. Like pestering worms crawling, wriggling, writhing inside your skin. Subcutaneously at first, until it digs deeper and more burrowed at the different levels of your skin, down to the folds of your flesh. Your entire body’s on fire. Hands flailing around, aggressively scratching any limb and patch of skin it meets. It’s still not enough. You press harder and stronger. You start to hit yourself. You want so badly to bleed, to open up a wound on your tendons and desperately reach inside and scratch, scratch, scratch. You want to peel off your skin inch by inch to be free of this internal anguish. As it reaches the very core of your being, you suddenly feel claustrophobic in your own body. It’s in your bones now and you can’t do anything about it. Your mind is running laps; all you can think about is getting rid of this excruciating unbearable itch that came from god knows where—and then, something snaps.

# her pt. 3 (limerence version)

tonight i dreamt of you for the last time. 

the image of you leapt at my defenseless gaze from the bridge between phantasm and reality. you were standing there beside the glass pillars that i've always associated your name with. you were looking so soft and still so unconventionally pretty. 

in this dream, we locked eyes and felt a painful understanding. no words were exchanged as we tip toed in that humid room filled with vines and familiriaty. we go about our ways but you were never within my sight and reach—you're either far away in front of me or behind me, but never beside me. 

'cause all you ever were was a gust of jaded mist passing by, caressing my burning skin trying to soothe the intensity of my foreboding. it was quick and it never did much but i wanted the icy touch of the mist. but it wasn't what i needed.

so i asked myself what could a mist do that can satiate the hunger of the fire that i cultivated from the depths of my fantasies? nothing really happens if the mist and fire interact—there are no sparks or collisions of a thousand dying stars. all i can do is reach out my hand but my touch will just go right through you.

the whole time i was chasing after an idea. wearing these rose-colored glasses, looking at a promising future that doesn't even exist. it was a harmless thing until everything caught up to me. the obsession started to fire up and it came at me all at once, choking me where i stand, pulling me into its abyss.

sleepless nights, an anxious mind, potent nightmares, intoxications of reverie. constant rumination, intrusive thoughts, isolation, instability, erratic, an inescapable black hole of attraction. i couldn't get enough of it. like a free-form junkie chasing the high at its highest, flying up and up, until there's no more to climb up, then comes the falling. only to realize far far later that i have been falling for quite some time.  and i was just too naive to sense gravity working against me. 

i want to say you're to blame for everything that's gone wrong but that would be unreasonable. i want to say i'm the only problem in the first place but that would be unfair. really, none of us should be left guilty of any unmerciful crimes, we were just a pair of playing cards dealt in the wrong hands of fate. 

in the midst of it all, i learned a fundamental truth about myself, which cost me almost everything: i treated you as an object for my own self-actualization. i never treated you as a friend, i'm deeply sorry for that. i was never in love with you, i guess that's something i should be thankful of. and this was never your typical love story. it was just this; a story. and like every story, it has its beginning and end. there was nothing special about it.

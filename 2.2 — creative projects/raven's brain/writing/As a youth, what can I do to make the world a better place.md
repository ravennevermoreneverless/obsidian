# As a youth, what can I do to make the world a better place?

26 years ago, a twelve-year-old's speech silenced the world on behalf of the group of youths trying to make a difference. And 26 years later, what changed? The powerful speech opened hearts, minds, and eyes of the adults, yet what did they do? The children's voices fell deaf in their ears and continued on with their wrong doings.

Ironically, the grown-ups tell us what to do and what not-to-do, what the bad things are in life; but they do the exact same thing. They teach us good morals, good qualities and values; then why is it that they do the exact opposite of those? They twist their words, they dirty their intentions and they drive themselves twards the edge with no control whatsoever. Why is it that the childrens of the earth, with the least experience, have the clearest and purest intentions for the better world? Young people aren't just the leaders of tomorrow - we're making some changes to the world around us, right about now. Whether it's through social media, writing opinions and foresights about the country's issues, takingÂ  partin a protest, there are plenty of ways to contribute for the road of change.

First off, we have volunteerism. Volunteering community services doesn't just add up to your experiences - may it be in a science investigatory project for the environment, orienting personal hygiene, a cleaning project in your city; we are already taking giant steps towards a better future.

Next, write to your local or city officials. Notify them of the problems in your area. Write them a detailed letter, proposals, suggestions or even hold a meeting to show them what you think they should be focusing on.

Voice out your opinions, reach out to millions of people around the world. Write blogs, send editorials, create "hashtags" for social awareness, participate in youth development groups. Inspire others to join you, encourage them to teach others, as well. Give everyone a role to take part in this. Show them every ideas matter because there is strength in numbers that would make a much wider difference. Don't be afraid of speaking out your mind because there is freedom in speech.

But you know what I think? Not only the youngsters can take part in changing the world. We cannot do this alone. We need unity and integration. Youth is only the stepping stone and the fuel boost to kick start the engine and drive towards the goal. And adults must change their ways. They must empower the youth. When given the opportunity, supprt and space, youth can and will rise. With the knowledge and skills to help them reach their full potentials; and withthe help of the past generations, we can actually make it. We need to take action, change our ways and tackle the most important issues. If you think about it, we can achieve a brighter future for all.

We are all part of something big. We are part of one ginormous family and we are all in this together. We are all children of this earth. The human race is going to be its own apocalypse. And we might let it lead to that; let's not lose faith and hope. This is humanity.

As a youth, I am speaking to everyone. You're never too young nor too old to change the world. My whole life they said I'd be nothing, but I am something. I would rather be a stray with a purpose and a thirst for a difference, than be nothing's no one at all.

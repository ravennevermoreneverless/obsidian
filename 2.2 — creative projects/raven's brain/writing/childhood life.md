# childhood life

Nothing is more wonderful
than living a childhood life
You eat and play all day,
without a care and problem in the world
Enjoying hot summer days,
and building snowmen on winter nights
The euphoria you feel
Unfortunately can't last forever
Yes, it is wonderful
But deadly if you choose to live it, eternally

# her pt. 5

until all my dying breaths lose their accidental glimpses of wonder,

until all my last poems have been crushed and dismantled,

until all my fantasies have soured up and been reused again and again as i lay alone each night,

until i’ve learned to ache for every single part of you,

until i’ve felt all the different variations of grief there is to be known and discovered,

until i’ve lived and died a hundred million times as if a phoenix wanting to be reborn as a lone raven instead—

  

i’ll think of you.

  

and even after that, in all the infinitesimal moments we shared and those we never had the chance to,

  

i’ll think of you again.

  

and even if my body refuses to take in the disgustingly abnormal amounts of limerence one lethal dose should have—i’m sick of it—

  

i’ll still think of you, over and over.

  

and even though god recreates a caricature of earth, there’s still going to be some idiot who travels across dreams, willing to peel their whole skin off just to go back to the past, relive the moment we met and stretch it across a millennium—

  

you are everything i will ever have the right to think about.

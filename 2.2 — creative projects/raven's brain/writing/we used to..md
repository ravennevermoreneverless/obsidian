# we used to.

we used to talk about how we wanted to just run away from this godforsaken place and start anew.

we used to talk about how we would find a place and live together and own a cat or three.

we used to talk about how hard it was to just keep going and finish everything we've started. 

we used to talk about our dreams and future and how we imagined we both would be in each other's. 

we used to talk so much under that pale moonlight, sitting on the sidewalk until it was too late to go home so we just stayed there until the sun rose.  

we used to do these things, our relationship growing stronger by the second but by the time i told you how i loved you and how i wanted to be with you, everything just stopped. you said it was fine and things would stay the same. that was the first and last time you ever told me a lie.

we never talked since.

# untitled(2)

Yesterday, I was this close to giving up.
This unexplainable feeling inside of me.
It's overwhelming.
It's about to explode.
About to blow up with so much emotions.
But I couldn't so it just stuck there.
Something is stuck in my throat.
I want to cry but I couldn't cry, it's suffocating.
My tears want to come out but it couldn't come out, it's hurting me.

I'm hurt.
Someone please help me.
Someone please notice.
Someone please understand.
This pain and numbness that I'm feeling.
The empty black void slowly consuming me.
I need to get out.
Let me out.

A black cloud over me following me around.
Closer and closer to the edge, stop pushing me.
I don't want to fall, why do you want me to?
I look in the mirror, I don't see myself anymore.

Is there someone out there?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to say?

Â "Be happy", "be positive", "enjoy the small things in life"; do you think it's that easy?
You don't understand, no one ever does.

I'm on top of the world, two steps ahead and I'll fly with no wings.
Do they see?
Will someone notice?

It's the end, maybe it's better this way.

# dear mom and dad

Dear mom and dad,

I’m sorry I killed you both in your sleep. I had to. I made it as quick and painless as possible—8 clean stabs on the chest and a slit on the throat did good. But I don’t regret it, no, I won’t ever. It was for the best. You know, I had an epiphany when I woke up that night. I’m tired of being a good person, it’s taking so much effort to be one. Tired of caring for others, tired of loving, tired of losing. So I’ve decided I’m going to start living with contempt instead of compassion. I won’t have to worry about getting hurt. Killing would mean I won’t have to worry about getting attached, living in anxiety, constantly asking when they’ll be gone and dealing with grief once they’re actually gone, it’s best to leave it all in my own hands. I can’t love anymore, I know it’s just going to destroy me. Don’t worry, I’ll take out Georgie and Kayla with a bullet on each their heads; suffocating them would only make them suffer, I know you don’t want that. This is for the best.

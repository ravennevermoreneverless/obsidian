# heaven-sent, unwanted 0.00 (test)

A resounding laughter came out from my stomach to my lips, as if it’s my own. But I know too well it never was. My uncle and I made eye-contact—his eyes were smiling, too. My aunt was cracking jokes, which was well-received from everyone. My cousins joined in the fun. The joy floated through the living room lamps, framed photographs and the white cobwebbed ceiling. I was holding my mug of lukewarm coffee and I can feel the miniscule heat touch the sides of my fingers. I could smell the lack of indifference from where I was. I just knew what I was experiencing, is what we would normally call a “bond.” And yet there I stood, not awkwardly, actually a bit carefree and comfortable, but I could sense, at the very bottom of my heart, something was disagreeing. Something or someone was writing down a neverending book about how they were feeling and it kept coming up with blank pages after blank pages—there was something deeply wrong inside me. 

My vision tripled in its size, like a 360 view of the room, almost as if I could even see a third dimension in my peripherals. And then before I know it, my feet lifted off the ground until the tip of my head touched the lights. I lost all bodily sensations. I floated through and past the roof, and no one ever noticed—not a single slant of lips was changed. Another round of laughter reverberated in that same room, but I was nowhere to be found. I could still see their figures past the walls but I just kept on sailing away, into the night sky, higher than the street lights and second-floor roofs, until I’m beside the clouds. And still I continued to ascend. The vision of what resembled a heart slowly faded out of view. I can hear every single person in the planet voicing out their emotions simultaneously, and I could feel myself becoming inhuman. 

Soundlessly, I was being carried away, rising up indefinitely, until I can see the roundness of the planet and the shade of the moon. The sun peaked from behind it—its eyes were smiling, too. And still, my body—at least, what resembles it—climbed towards no destination. I was among the stars, and even them knew how to beam wholeheartedly. Even them knew better than I what it was to be a living being, capable of sharing cosmic connections and building something beautiful. I could still see the Earth from where I was, albeit a small dot from the endless view I was given. For what seemed like eternity, I soared and loomed upwards, almost blending in with all the dark energy, gravity and fields of unknown matter. Multi-colored stardust and heavenly space rocks were my companions this time, and somehow this fraction of the universe resembles the living room where I originally was. Even then, in spite of everything, amidst every fiber of Creation; I was unmovingly, painstakingly, mercilessly, grievously alone.

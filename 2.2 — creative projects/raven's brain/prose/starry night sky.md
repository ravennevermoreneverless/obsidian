i gave her the other piece of the ear phone while sitting beside each other on a car ride with friends. i put on a song i knew that she would like and i decided i wanted to turn it magical. as we listened to the song, i turned the night sky to the painting she loved the most: "starry night". i turned our surroundings to the color she absolutely adored: "yellow". i told her to look outside, look at the sky. she was so fascinated by it that we had to stop the car so she can climb up the car roof and stand there, gazing admirably at the wonderful night sky above her. 

by the climax of the song, i gazed at her lovingly, smiled wholeheartedly and hoped she knows this was how much i love her. this was how much i want to make her happy. 

near the end of the song, she climbed down the car. she turned to me and held my hand, and led me to the stairs by the river. we stood there, just holding hands, looking up with a smile on our faces. this was such a magical experience, for me and for her, and i didn't want the moment to end.   

but it did. 

she excused herself as she took out her phone and called someone. i didn't think about it that much. minutes later, someone came without me noticing. my friends told us to go back to the car because we had to go now so we did. in the car, i was confused why she didn't sit beside me that time. i looked at the rear-view mirror and saw her head layed on her boyfriend's shoulder, both of them with a warm smile on their faces. 

oh yeah.

i kind of forgot. 

with all the wishful thinking in my head, i forgot how she never saw me in that way. with all the love i kept giving her, i was blinded by the fact that she only thought of me as a friend. 

that's probably why none of the pictures i took of her on the car roof ever turned great. they were all blurry and distorted. just like the idea of us together.  

this was reality. 

and i need to snap out of it.
  
who am i kidding anyways? why would she ever see me as someone other than a friend?  

after all,

i'm just a girl who's in love with a straight girl.

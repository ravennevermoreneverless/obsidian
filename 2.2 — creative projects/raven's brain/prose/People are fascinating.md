People are fascinating. And I am people, so that must mean I'm also fascinating. But people are weird. And I'm people, too. Therefore I'm weird. People are cruel, and I can be cruel because I am people. People are strangers, everyone are strangers, therefore I'm a stranger, also. A stranger. To everyone else? To me. Look around me. We're strangers striving for familiarity. A sense of intimacy. An inkling of affection. But we are strangers. And strangers have the tendency to hurt people. We're prickly individuals. Hedgehogs? We hurt without meaning to. Hurt ourselves and others. Because we love. We hurt because we love. Is love a bad thing then? How could we tell? Do you know what love is? I don't. It's the most fascinating thing that I'll never understand. Love is fascinating. People are fascinating. Is love people? If yes, then I don't understand people. But I am people. Therefore I don't understand myself. Love is myself yet I don't understand it. I don't love myself. But I hurt. Hurting for me and for people, always. If there's hurt, there must be love. Love exists within us therefore we hurt. We are capable of loving, therefore we suffer. Love is people. People are living. Living is for suffering. Suffering is loving without the people who are living.

tonight i dreamt of you for the last time. 

the image of you leapt at my defenseless gaze from the bridge between phantasm and reality. you were standing there 

beside the glass pillars that i've always associated your name with. you were looking so soft and still so unconventionally pretty. 

in this dream, we locked eyes and felt a painful understanding. no words were exchanged as we tip toed in that humid room filled with vines and familiriaty. we go about our ways but you were never within my sight and reach—you're either far away in front of me or behind me, but never beside me. 

'cause all you ever were was a gust of jaded mist passing by, caressing my burning skin trying to soothe the intensity of my foreboding. it was quick and it never did much but i wanted the icy touch of the mist. but it wasn't what i needed.

so i asked myself what could a mist do that can satiate the hunger of the fire that i cultivated from the depths of my fantasies? nothing really happens if the mist and fire interact—there are no sparks or collisions of a thousand dying stars. all i can do is reach out my hand but my touch will just go right through you. 

the whole time i was chasing after an idea. wearing these rose-colored glasses, looking at a promising future that doesn't even exist. it was a harmless thing until i realized i wanted to fall in love. but i didn't. god, i'm so glad i didn't. 

you made me realize that i'm capable of a lot of things; of wanting. of trying. of not giving up. of being happy. but most of all i realized that i'm capable of deserving better. 

a vague dream, a distant memory, a lover from a different timeline.

words left unsaid, things left undone, an unfinished work of art.

did we make the right choice? did you ever really want this? 

was i too much? or were you just too little?


you know, maybe if life allows it,

i'll be able to hold your hand. 

but until then,

let's just stay in our neverland. 

  

--

and here we are again, in a state of longing and unending inner fantasies blooming when the clock strikes midnight. it's only been 2 months since the split. our love was shorter than a handspan, certain words were never uttered out loud and yet why is it harder to forget? i'm still trying to look past everything and start thinking about "what has been"s and what has been said instead of ruminating on the questions of "what could've been"s and the regrets of "i should've said"s. 

i wish you could've stayed longer but i wish i'd fought harder to make you stay. i wish i had known you better and i wish you'd let me. darling, i hope you know that it hurts still and i miss you tenderly every single night—the look of your smile still lingers in my mind and the sound of your voice that's slowly fading now. but also know that it hurts a little bit lesser than before and i'm getting used to scratching out the contours of your image in the photograph that we made.  

i'm currently walking towards a point where i can look back fondly towards our shared instances and the steps we made onto building our budding connection. tears still well up in my eyes, not because of grief and not because i didn't get what i wanted, but because i knew what we had was something special and i'm learning to accept that fact. there will always be a part of you in me but now it's time we go our separate ways. i'm typing this message that i know i'll never send and i'm typing this message as a closing to the last chapter in the book that we call "us". goodbye, lost love.

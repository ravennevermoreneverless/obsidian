I like you so much better when you're throwing up. When you're sniveling on the bathroom floor, moaning in so much pain, wet and drenched in all your bodily fluids, dribbling down the sides of your face and chin. I love it when you're so fucking helpless that you can't even open your mouth to tell me how much you're suffering. I adore you so much when your insides are turning and you can't hold it in; you projectile vomit as hard as an uncontrollable sneeze that bile comes out of your nostrils, almost out of your left eyeball. Tears are streaming down your face and I thought that's the most attractive you've ever been to my eyes.

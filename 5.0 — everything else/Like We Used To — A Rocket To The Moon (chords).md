[Intro]

D   F#m   G   Bm   A
D   F#m   G   Gm


[Verse]

D                   F#m               G
I could feel her breath as she’s sleeping next to me
Bm            A        G
Sharing pillows and cold feet
D                  F#m          G
She can feel my heart; fell asleep to its beat
Bm         A             G
Under blankets and warm sheets
Em               D              A
If only I could be in that bed again
Em               D              A (4x)[abrupt stop]
If only it were me instead of him


[Chorus]

          D
Does he watch your favorite movies?
          F#m
Does he hold you when you cry?
                 G
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts?
             Bm                   A
When you’ve seen it a million times
           D
Does he sing to all your music?
             Em
While you dance to purple rain
            Bm   A        G [let it ring]
Does he do all these things?

Like I used to?


[Instrumental]

D   F#m   G   Bm   A
D   F#m   G   Bm   A


[Verse]

D        F#m       G
fourteen months and seven days ago,
                Bm         A              G
Oh I know you know how we felt about that night
D          F#m                G
Just your skin against the window
                 Bm   A           G
But we took it slow and we both know
Em                 D               A
It should've been me inside that car
Em                  D              A (5x)
It should have been me instead of him in the dark


[Chorus]

          D
Does he watch your favorite movies?
          F#m
Does he hold you when you cry?
                 G
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts?
             Bm                   A
When you’ve seen it a million times
           D
Does he sing to all your music?
             Em
While you dance to purple rain
            Bm   A        G 
Does he do all these things?
                   D
Like I used to.



[Bridge]

G
I know, love (I’m a sucker for that feeling)
                   D                  A
Happens all the time, love (I always end up feeling cheated)
              G
You’re on my mind, love (Oh darlin', I know I’m not needed)
                       D                A
And that happens all the time, love yeah


[Chorus]

          D          
Will he love you like I loved you?
         F#m
Will he tell you everyday?
                  G
Will he make you feel like your invincible
       Bm              A
With every word he’ll say
             D
Can you promise me that this was right?
       Em
Don’t throw it all away
            Bm   A      G
Can you do all these things?
             Bm    A       G
Will you do all these things?
             D
Like we used to


[Outro]

D   F#m   G   Bm   A
D   F#m   G   Bm   A   D

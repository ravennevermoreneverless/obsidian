Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na na na na



D              A
I'm aware that I am an asshole
  G            D     A            G
I really don't care about all of that though
D
Na na na na, na na na na,
      A          D
I got nothing to prove

Na na na na, na na na na,
    A                          D
But honestly I'm just like you



D    A  D  G  D  A  G x2



D                      A G
I've got a bad case of ADD
D                        A     G
I've been this way since seventeen
        D
I got a fucked up brain
       A          G
And a really bad attitude

I blame it on my drug abuse



D            
So you don't want to be
A     G       D
Too close to me
                       A      G
Cause you might see my broken heart

  G            D     A            G

D                
I'm living my life
    A    
The way that I want to
    G            D 
And you can't deny
      A                     D

Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na na na na (Just Like You)



D                            A       G
I've been so lonely for the longest time
D                            A        G
They tell me that I'm such a loveable guy (yeah right)
D                A       G         D
Could it be because I'm off my meds?
                      A          G
Or could it be just something I said?



D            
So you don't want to be

                Bm                  D
And I'm always stuck with some bad luck
               G          A           Bm
And I'm just a boy who's angry at his mom
             F#                  D
And Hope in fact she breaks her back
                  A       G
The moment I step on this crack


                  A               G
And don't tell me I'm not worth it
             A
Cuz You are far from perfect

Who the hell cares about all of that though?

## DIFFERENT ASPECTS
#### STRENGTHS (What am I great at?)
- Curiosity — I ask questions all the time. I seek to always explore new ideas and experiences to further expand my knowledge. 
- Perseverance — I work hard through every challenge I encounter. I don't give up that easily but I do know when to give up. I have a strong tolerance for frustration so I'm determined to see things through, from start to finish, no matter how much the gratification would be. I don't believe things are in vain if they ended in a stale manner. 
- Hope — I always look at the positive things despite all the negatives. I believe things will always turn out for the better, as long as we're alive.
- Humor — I make sure not to always take myself and life so seriously. Everything is absurd, and if I look at everything in a strict manner, I'd go insane. 
- Creativity — I come up with new, original, and interesting ideas that benefit me or others. 
- Humility — I have an accurate sense of who I am and my accomplishments. I am aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I make sure to always have an honest evaluation of myself, good and bad. 
- Honesty — I tell the truth, even if it means being caught in a huge mess because of it. I'm honest with my feelings and thoughts to myself. Because I believe the truth will set you free. 
- Love of learning — I want to understand things deeply. I enjoy mastering new skills and studying new topics purely for the sake of learning and better understanding. 
- Appreciation of Beauty & Excellence — I notice and get usually moved by physical beauty, art, music, talent, and even just the mundane. I'd always fall in a sense of clarity when I encounter the wonders the universe could offer. 
- Self-regulation — I make sure to check in how I'm doing with everything I do, feel, and think. I develop routines, schedules, plans, so that I can stay sharp and always on point when tackling my days. I also regulate my moods and self-care by keeping track of them. I journal everything significant that happens in my life which requires further contemplation and an eventual decision. 
- Perspective — I look at the bigger pictures in life. I can look beyond the details and frustrations of the moment. When given a situation, I always look at multiple sides, draw from both experiences and facts, then make a sensible conclusion. 

### JOY AT WORK (What do I love doing so much that I would do it for free?)
- Learning 
- Making art
- Listening to music
- Analyzing and critiquing art
- Reading literature 

### FLOW STATE (Where do I get so involved in an activity that I lose track of time?)
- Learning/studying
- Making art
- Reading literature  

### PURPOSE (What sense of duty or mission motivates me in my work or life?) 
- There's so much out there that I've yet to see, discover, learn, and experience. It's my job to be there and encapsulate most of everything in my small human mind in my short human life.

### BLOCKERS (Where do I get stuck?)
- Socializing — I don't really struggle with small talk or relating to other people. The thing I struggle with is how I present myself to other people, because I'm not really sure where I stand. Plus I worry about what they would think of me so it gets in the way of the heart of socializing, which is just being there and getting along.
- Hard to connect — I always think that no one would really understand the complexities of myself. And in turn, I don't have that much interest in finding out who other people really are. 
- Difficulty expressing love & intimacy — I don't know love and I can't feel it. I fail to understand what it really is, how it really feels, and how to express it. Even though I am in love with what I do, I don't know how to love people.
- Dealing with conflicts — I avoid conflicts as much as possible because I fear that it'll turn into arguments, then fights. I would think arguments would reveal something about me that I don't want people to see. I would think arguments are direct attacks to who I am. 
- Cowardice — I run away, from everything and everyone, all the time. As soon as things become sour, I turn on my heel and run to the other direction. I don't want to deal with these issues and it gives me relief when I run away. 

### SELF-SABOTAGE (How do I get in my own way?)
- Self-loathing — No matter what I do, there will always be a part of me deep inside who absolutely despises who I am. Anytime I do something wrong, it's just there, urging me to self-sabotage because it makes me believe I don't deserve good things. 
- Lack of impulse control — I crave instant gratification. Any quick immediate relief I'd seek it and do everything I can to attain it. That's why I'm susceptible to addiction and a tendency to obsession. I know the bad effects of engaging in excess but I lack the control of my impulses.
- Harsh self-critique — I'm the worst judge of myself. I pride myself for my self-awareness, but sometimes it gets really intense, to the point where I beat myself up for small mistakes and errors. This is also why I can't take outside criticisms because I'd think it's an attack towards myself, who's already beaten up by my own self-critique. I would crumble in the face of judgment. 
- Social anxiety — I always think about what other people would think of me. In the way I talk, the way I dress, the way I present myself—I'd think everyone would just say something bad, and I fear that. Even when I tell myself what they say doesn't really matter, I still do care in certain amounts. 
- Insecurities — There are a lot of things I wish were different in myself. I wish I was taller, smarter, fitter, more extroverted. I look at other people, compare myself to them, and feel bad because I feel likemy life would be better if I just have what they have. 
- Low self-esteem — I don't believe in myself and my capabilities. I fear that I will fail at some point and that would be a bruise to my ego. I have difficulty accepting criticism. That's why I tend to be a people-pleaser. I want people to like me because I find it hard to see myself as likable. I turn to external validation. I have inferiority complex disguised as superiority complex. I imagine myself better than everyone I meet, when in truth, it's just me finding reasons for seeing myself as good and likable. 

### VALUES (What are the values in my life that I am committed to?)
- Self-direction — The main thing that drives me is my passion towards traveling my own unique path and fulfilling a meaningful purpose. May it be mastering a skill, achieving a long-term goal, or self-actualization. I always strive to become the better version of myself and to keep on growing and improving. 
- Universalism — Even if I say I don't care or love people and I find it hard to connect, I still do believe in the greater good of all things and strive for it. I don't want to be a bad person and actively hurt other people, I'm sure of that. I always want what's best for everyone. 
- Hedonism — I'm a seeker of pleasure in all aspects. I want to live the good comfortable content blissful life. I want to continue doing the things I love and spending my time meaningfully.
- Security — I prioritize stability, structure, and harmony. I want things to be in order so I set up systems and plan things to live in safety. Not that I'd want to live in a perfect manner, but to live in a way that there is as minimal danger as possible. 

### PAST (What life experiences have shaped me? Where have I seen self-growth?) 
- Poverty — For most of my life, I lived in a family ridden with poverty. There are days when we eat little to no food. We moved houses a lot because the rent would be too expensive. I'd skip classes because I'd have no money for food. All of these made me appreciate everything in my life and to be grateful for whatever I have right now that gives me comfort, no matter how small. 
- Mental illness — I struggle with fluctuations of my moods and psyche as early as adolescence. I would be either too depressed where I struggle to do even the most basic tasks and I'd feel suicidal or too elated I'd believe I can do everything and anything in a short period of time. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my late teens. Because I asked to be checked. That was what started to make me choose myself. From then on, I kept fighting—struggled, fell down, yet kept climbing up—all because I chose myself each and every time. I learned to live and be alive and to exist and to make choices that kept me here.
- Limerence — I thought I fell in love and that I learned what love really is. But as time goes by, I realized that it was obsession. A deep-rooted desire for reciprocation. It was something that told me that there was something seriously wrong with me; my attachments, tendency to addiction, my loneliness, and how I perceive relationships. I realized it was limerence I was experiencing, and still experiencing. It made me more self-aware, I learned a lot about myself. But the only way to overcome this is to cut all ties with my LO. And so that's what I did. It's my greatest heartbreak yet but I'm glad I did that because in the end, I chose myself. 
- Solitary choices — I deleted most of my personal social media accounts. Not because I was addicted, but because I wanted to remove myself from everything. I needed more time to live in contemplation and further thinking. I can't engage in interactions and relationships if I have the tendency to hurt others and be hurt in return. I want to fix whatever what's left of me and become someone tolerable. Someone who won't just up and leave someone as soon things turn bad. I took my time to feel alive, to find myself amongst all the rubble.
- Emotional Neglect — I've read that one of the effects of having an absent parent is failing to experience love and affection. That's exactly what happened to me. I find it extremely hard to express intimacy. I fear devoting myself and being totally vulnerable with other people. It made me sever all the connections I have of what I thought were meaningful relationships. But it served as my tipping point. I needed that breakthrough so that I can learn to choose myself, so that I can choose others. 

### FUTURE (What would true fulfillment look like? What and who is part of that?) 
- I've always wanted to live quietly, peacefully, and content on my own. In my own apartment, doing what I love, whatever it may be, and being financially comfortable. I want to experience having meaningful emotional connections with people yet still maintaining that distance which allows for more alone time. 

### LEGACY (What would I want the words at my funeral to say? How do I want to be remembered?)
- A lover of life, universe, and everything. Someone who always chose life, no matter if confronted by the sweet release of death almost on a daily basis. A dreamer, an idealist, deeply introspective, driven by passion and a strong sense of purpose, heavily emotional, always always trying to find what it's all for, never quitting, never stopping, relentless. A believer of there is always something in everything, no matter how small and miniscule or how large and incomprehensible.

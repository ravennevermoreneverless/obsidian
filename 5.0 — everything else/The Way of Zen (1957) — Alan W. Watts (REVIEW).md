jesus, this took me more than a month to finish. to be fair, i was too busy with work and i wasn't actually just "reading" it from start to finish. i really took my time understanding the concepts and writing down my thoughts whilst reading for the second time around.

what i got from this book:

the center of the mind's activity, is not in the conscious thinking process, not in the ego. in taoism, there is what we call "no-mind" which is a state of wholeness in which the mind functions freely and easily, without the sensation of a second mind or ego.

in buddhism, moksha is a "liberation" from maya (illusion which veils the underlying reality of brahman), an experience or state of consciousness. we don't really know exactly what this is, but indian philosophy is primarily this experience. another interesting thing is "samsara"-an everlasting round of birth-and-death which goes on and on for as long as man tries to grasp at his own life. an active principle of samsara is karma (conditioned action) arising from a motive and seeking a result.

the four truths of buddhism:

1st truth - 3 characteristics of being/becoming (bhava):

(1) duhkha - "suffering" or "frustration" from attempting the impossible, (2) anitya - impermanence (the more you grasp at the world, the more it changes), (3) anatman - absence of any self (the true self is non-self)

2nd truth - the cause of frustration is trishna (clinging or grasping), the desire for perfect control

3rd truth ending of self-frustration, grasping, and karma: NIRVANA = moksha. it is impossible to desire or attain nirvana-anything desirable as an object of action is not nirvana

4th truth eightfold path of the buddha's dharma: method or doctrine where self-frustration ends

in mahayana buddhism, buddha remained silent when questioned about the nature of nirvana or the reality of self -as they deem it irrelevant. "if there is no nirvana in which can be attained, and if, in reality, there are no individual entities, our bondage in the round is merely apparent, and that in fact we are already in nirvana-to seek nirvana is folly of looking for what one has never lost." we must all believe that we're already buddha.

zen is the combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism-any attempt to formulate it in words is to distort it. the starting point of zen is to understand the absurdity of choosing, of believing life will improve by always choosing the "good". our precious "self" is just an idea because the power of thought allows us to construct symbols of things apart from the things themselves. decision is neither voluntary nor involuntary. if we think that every decision is preceded by a decision-then that's an infinite regression. zen looks at this in a way that decision "just happens"; without having the faintest understanding of how we do it. there is never anything but the present, and if one cannot live there, one cannot live anywhere. zen begins at the point where there is nothing further to seek, nothing to be gained. there is "nothing special", everything is perfectly natural and unaffected. awakening is not about knowing what reality is, it's about knowing what reality is not.

by reading this, it's very clear that learning about zen, actually leaves me with more questions than answers-but somehow i understand why it's that way. any attempts of describing zen, or what awakening really is, is just futile attempt of encompassing this liberation through mere limits of human speech. but thinking of it that way, as something beyond words, still gives it an objectification- still something that can be grasped, even as an idea. no matter how we look at it, everything we touch are tainted by our muddied human hands. there's always a limit to understanding. we're simply not designed to exceed that limit, no matter how we wish for it.

but anyways, finishing this on a weekend, somehow made me feel lighter and free-spirited. even if you don't fully believe in what these ideologies can offer, there's still a little bit of something valuable to add to our lives that we can take away from all of this. one thing is that the present is all i have-i don't have to be chained up and held down by the ghosts of the past or the expectations of the future. another thing is that the person i call "self" right now, might not even exist at all-somehow that idea liberates me. there are far bigger things than what my current world consists of. it's not like it's making me ignorant of my range of influences. it's just that, it makes me look at things in an entirely different perspective. i don't let shit weigh me down, no matter how heavy, because it's really nothing personal-it just is.

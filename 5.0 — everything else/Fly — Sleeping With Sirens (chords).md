 [Intro]

G   Bm
   Woo!
                    D     Em  Bm
Can we fly, can we fly away?

[Verse 1]

Bm
I'm sitting on the edge,

                                 D
A thousand stars burning in the sky up overhead.

 A                                     Bm
How could it get more beautiful than this?

Bm
And it made me think of when,

                             D
When in my life have I ever felt more infinite?

 A                                Bm
And could I ever get back there again?


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm
That's the way it goes,

Bm
You fall so short, sometimes you feel so close,

D                                         A
But when you find the thing that matters most,
 A
May you never let it go.

 Bm                                             
(That's the way it goes, that's the way it goes)


[Chorus]

  Bm
   I wanna fly!

              F#m 
I'm ready to burn down all the walls

                G
That I've been building up inside, whoa

 Bm
I wanna fly!

    F#m        
And put back all the pieces of this

 G                      A
Broken heart tonight, whoa, whoa

G                   Bm
Can we fly, can we fly away?

G                D
Can we fly, can we fly?

Bm                      D   Em  Bm         
The chorus, verses and pre-chorus have the same chords
Can we fly, can we fly away?


[Bridge]

 Bm                                            D      A
It's just the way, it's just the way it goes, whoa, whoa

 Bm                                            D      Em
It's just the way, it's just the way it goes, whoa, whoa

 Bm                    F#m               G      A
It's just the way, it's just the way it goes, whoa, whoa

Bm
It's just the way it goes!

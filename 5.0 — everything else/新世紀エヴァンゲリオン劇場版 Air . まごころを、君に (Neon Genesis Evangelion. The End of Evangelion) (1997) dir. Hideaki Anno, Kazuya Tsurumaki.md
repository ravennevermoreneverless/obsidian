i cannot even begin to form words on how i feel about this whole series and film. i felt **everything** and at the same time, i felt **nothing**. it will probably take me weeks to fully wrap my head about everything that has happened but idk, i guess i just want to let this out.

i preferred this ending over the series' (well, some say both can co-exist, as the series' ending focused on the "how" the apocalypse happened while the film focused on the "what".)  
for some reason, i liked the chaos and tragedy. i liked inflicting pain on myself by watching this. i relate so much to almost every character that i almost felt like i was exposed. i had to stop halfway through because i needed to take a breather. even so, an hour and 30 minutes felt like an eternity. it was a whole rollercoaster clusterfuck of different kinds of emotions, it left me so fucked up that i'm actually scheduling an appointment to see my pyschiatrist. it left me feeling so numb that i cannot, for the love of jesus, focus on other things because my mind will stick to this film, and the series. that was the impact to me.

i have finally found my most favorite anime but what did it cost? my fucking mental health.

[Chorus]
                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C
Only know you love her when you let her go
G
  And you let her go

[Instrumental]
Am   F   G   Em
Am   F   G

[Verse 1]
Am                            F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
        G                          Em
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
                  Am              F          G
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
    Am                          F
You see her when you close your eyes
      G                         Em
Maybe one day you'll understand why
               Am            F        G
Everything you touch surely dies

[Chorus]
                      F                           C
But you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Am                            F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
         G                     Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
                    Am              F       G
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
         Am                      F
Well you see her when you fall asleep
             G                  Em
But never to touch and never to keep
                         Am
'Cause you loved her too much
                F        G
And you dived too deep

[Chorus]
                        F                           C
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                           C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                         C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Bridge]
                Am
And you let her go
      F     G
Ooooo ooooo oooooo
                Am
And you let her go
        F     G
Ooooooo ooooo ooooo
                Am         F    G   Em
And you let her go

[Interlude]
Am    F    G

[Chorus]
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                          C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
                      F                            C
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
               F                          C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Chorus] (One Strum)
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
N.C.
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low

Only hate the road when you're missin' home

Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

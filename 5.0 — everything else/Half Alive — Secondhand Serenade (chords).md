[Verse 1]

(Plucking)
                  D                                    Bm
It's four AM, I'm waking up to your perfume 
                                          A
Don't get up, I'll get through on my own 
                                   G
I don't know if I'm home 
         D
Or if I lost the way into your room 
    Bm
I'm spiraling into my doom 
    A                                                      G
I'm feeling half alive but I know one day 
                  (strum)A
You and I will be free, 


[Chorus]

  Bm                               A                     D
To live and die by our own rules, Free...
G
Despite the fact that men are fools. 
 D                   G                                         Bm
I'm almost alive, and I need you to try 
         A
And save me. 
      D                               G
It's okay that we're dying, 
                              Bm      A             G
But I need to survive tonight, tonight. 


[Pluck]

D Bm A G


[Verse 2]

        D   
Well excuse me while I get killed softly, 
Bm                                                           A
Heart slows down and I can hardly tell you I'm okay 
      G
At least 'til yesterday, 
                            D
You know you got me off my highest guard, 
 Bm
Believe me when I say it's hard. 
            A
We'll get through this tonight 
                                  G                                  A
And I know one day you and I will be free 


[Chorus]

  Bm                               A                     D
To live and die by our own rules, Free...
G
Despite the fact that men are fools. 
 D                   G                                         Bm
I'm almost alive, and I need you to try 
         A
And save me. 
      D                               G
It's okay that we're dying, 
                              Bm      A             G
But I need to survive tonight, tonight. 


[Bridge]

[Part 1] (Shots)

A                                                       G
And you touch my hand ever so slightly 
                       
(Girl we're not ready for this yet) 
A                                                       G
And the deadly look she cast upon me 
                    A                       G
I won't regret, I won't regret                     
                    A                       G
I won't regret.   I won't regret... 


[Bridge Part 2]

                      D                     A
And I was trying to disappear, 
                                               G
But you got me wrapped around you 

I can hardly breathe without you 
             D                        A
I was trying to disappear 
                                          G
But I got lost in your eyes now, 

You brought me down to size now.

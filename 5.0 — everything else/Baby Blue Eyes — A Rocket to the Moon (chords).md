[Verse 1]
            G
My eyes are no good blind without her
            G/F#
The way she moves I never doubt her
         Em7               Dsus4           Cadd9   Dsus4
When she talks she somehow creeps into my dreams
        G
She's a doll, a catch, a winner
       G/F#
I'm in love and no beginner
           Em7           Dsus4
Could ever grasp or understand
          Cadd9    Dsus4
What she means


[Chorus]
G      Dsus4         Cadd9  Dsus4
Baby, baby blue eyes
                   Em7
Stay with me by my side
          Dsus4
Until the morning
      Cadd9      
Through the night
        G        Dsus4         Cadd9
Baby, stand here holding my sides
          Dsus4       Em7
Close your baby blue eyes
     Dsus4        Cadd9
Every moment feels right
     Dsus4
And I may feel like a fool
              D
But I'm the only one dancing with you


[Interlude]
Em Dsus4 Cadd9 Dsus4
Ooohoh     


[Verse]
G
I drive her home when she can't stand
G/F#
I like to think I'm a better man
         Em7                 Dsus4                 Cadd9
For not letting her do what she's been known to do
G
She wears heels and she always falls
G/F#
I let her think she's a know it all
        Em7             Dsus2           Cadd9
But whatever she does wrong it seems so right
Dsus4
My eyes don't believe her
D
But my heart swears by her


[Chorus]
G      Dsus4         Cadd9  Dsus4
Baby, baby blue eyes
                   Em7
Stay with me by my side
          Dsus4
Until the morning
      Cadd9      
Through the night
        G        Dsus4         Cadd9
Baby, stand here holding my sides
          Dsus4       Em7
Close your baby blue eyes
     Dsus4        Cadd9
Every moment feels right
     Dsus4
And I may feel like a fool
              D
But I'm the only one dancing with you


[Interlude]
Em Dsus4 Cadd9  G                 G/F#
Ohoohooh         I can't get you out of my mind


[Bridge]

Am7
I swear I've been there
D
I swear I've done that
Am7                   C
I'll do whatever it takes
            D
Just to see those


[Chorus]
G      Dsus4         Cadd9  Dsus4
Baby, baby blue eyes
                   Em7
Stay with me by my side
          Dsus4
Until the morning
      Cadd9
Through the night
        G        Dsus4         Cadd9
Baby, stand here holding my sides
          Dsus4       Em7
Close your baby blue eyes
     Dsus4        Cadd9
Every moment feels right
     Dsus4
And I may feel like a fool
              D
But I'm the only one dancing with you

G      Dsus4         Cadd9  Dsus4
Baby, baby blue eyes
                   Em7
Stay with me by my side
          Dsus4
Until the morning
      Cadd9
Through the night
        G        Dsus4         Cadd9
Baby, stand here holding my sides
          Dsus4       Em7
Close your baby blue eyes
     Dsus4        Cadd9
Every moment feels right


[Outro]
           G
My eyes are no good blind without her
            G/F#
The way she moves I never doubt her
        Em7                 Dsus4           Cadd9
When she talks she sometimes creep into my dreams

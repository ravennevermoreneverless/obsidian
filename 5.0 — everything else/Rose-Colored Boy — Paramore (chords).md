[Intro]

F   
Dm                       C                              F
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
    Dm                        C
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

Verse:
F
Rose-colored boy
                             Dm
I hear you making all that noise
                              C
About the world you want to see
      F
And oh, I'm so annoyed 
                                     Dm                   C
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me


[Refrain]
 Bb                  C                      Dm
Hearts are breaking, Wars are raging on
               C    
And I have taken my glasses off
Bb                 C
You got me nervous
                               Dm
I'm right at the end of my rope
               C
A half empty girl
                     F   
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

[Chorus]
             F    Am          Bb          
Just let me cry a little bit longer
              F      Am          Bb  C
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
             Bb                C
Hey man, we all can't be like you

                Bb                C
I wish we were all rose-colored too

                  F
My rose-colored boy
    Dm                      C
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

[Verse]
F                                      Dm           C
I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause
                              F
'Cause I've been through a lot
                                         Dm                          
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
C
If it's all right by you
Bb                  C                    Dm
Hearts are breaking, wars are raging on
                  F
And I have taken my glasses off
Bb                 C
You got me nervous
                               Dm
And youâ€™re turning it into a joke
               C
A half empty girl
                     F   
Don't make me laugh, I'll...


[Chorus]
             F    Am          Bb          
Just let me cry a little bit longer
              F      Am          Bb  C
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
             Bb                C
Hey man, we all can't be like you

                Bb                C
I wish we were all rose-colored too

                  Bb           C
My rose-colored boy

[bridge]
Bb
Leave me here a little bit longer
                            C
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
Bb
You say "We gotta look on the bright side"
                                  C
I say "Well maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind


[Chorus]
             F    Am          Bb          
Just let me cry a little bit longer
              F      Am          Bb  C
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
             Bb                C
Hey man, we all can't be like you

                Bb                C
I wish we were all rose-colored too                 
My rose-colored boy

             F    Am          Bb          
Just let me cry a little bit longer
              F      Am          Bb  C
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
        Bb                C
Nah, we all can't be like you
                Bb                C
I wish we were all rose-colored too

                  F
My rose-colored boy
Dm                          C                         F
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
Dm                           C
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

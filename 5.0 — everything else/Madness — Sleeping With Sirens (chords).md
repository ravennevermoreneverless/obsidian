**Capo on 1st Fret**


1ST VERSE (PLUCKING)
 M = 2x4xxx                 } My advice is to make power chords shapes, but only pluck
 N = 3x5xxx                 } what I noted here. Make an F# shape (2443xx) for M, play what I
 O = 5x7xxx                 } noted and slide from there to N, O, P etc. When you get to R,
 P = 7x9xxx                 } your finger will be already on place.
 Q = 6x8xxx                 } 
 R = xxx7xx                 }
 S = 10.12xxxx or x5x7xx    }

 M   N  O  P    P Q          O
 All of my life I built this armor
     M  N  O  P       Q R  O
 And every disguise I ever wore
 M N   O   P    P    Q       O
 Ashes and dust I've made an island
 M N    O   P      Q     R    S
 Facing the end, I said "What for?"

 Bm = 7997xx            }  ---------------------          } the A and D strings together to play
 Gm = 355333            }  -G------G-----G------          } the D (LOOK AT THE OUTRO)

A                  Bm
 Sometimes it’s a battle

A                    Bm
 But you’re never defenseless

 D                  A
 After our time has passed
             Bm                   G

VERSE 2 (AFTER EACH CHORD KEEP PLAYING THE HIGHEST STRING OF EACH CHORD NOTED UNTIL THE NEXT 
        ONE APPEARS):
 
 M   N  O    P     P Q          O
 Out of the skies, I shaped the silence
 M   N    O   P        Q      R     O
 And from the earth, I carved these walls
   M     N  O   P     P   Q R  O
 A piece of the world was only mine
 M   N    O P      Q  R   S
 And then I said I wanted more

A                   Bm
 At the edge of the blackness
A                             Bm
 When you’re stretched to the core
A                  Bm
 Catch hold of the madness

     Gm                D *
 Sometimes we all lose strength

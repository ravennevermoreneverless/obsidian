![[Soundtracks for the Blind (1996) â€” Swans.jpg]]

off to an absolutely mind blowing start, i don't think i've ever experienced anything like this before. this is the reason why i listen to music, shit like this keeps me going. ***helpless child*** transported me to another dimension and opened up a part of me i didn't know existed. but with that being said, the whole album is something hard to listen through in one sitting even though i just did. it would be significantly difficult to give this another listen as something about makes me feel unbearably uncomfortable. it's just pure art, it speaks to your soul that your feeble mind can't just articulate into words and describe what it makes you feel, but then it was really off to a cinematic start but almost fell flat and dwindling down near the end. the last track was a bit anticlimactic (or is that just me?).

***helpless child*** and ***volcano*** are my two favorites from this album. ***volcano*** was such a peculiar track; it's odd, disturbing and the most dissonant yet melodic amongst the tracks.

 C                                       G
You and I both, we come from different worlds
                                            F
I'm a small town kid and you're an uptown girl
                                     Dm
We've both been hurt, we got a few scars
                                                C
But it don't matter now, we're staring at the stars

  C                                            G
When it comes to my heart you gotta catch and fall
                                          F
Deep down in my soul I know that I would die
                                        Dm
If I didn't have you how could I ever fly? 
                      C
100 miles beyond the sky



[Chorus x2:]

  C                                       G
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
                                    F
It's feeling like we never coming down

Till' we want to
                       C
But why would we want to (night)?

   C                                     G
Remember that day, we knew it from the start
                                           F
We've come a long way and we're gonna go far
                          Dm
I see the future in your eyes
                            C
Forever and always, you and I


[Chorus x2:]

  C                                       G
It's feeling like we're high above the ground
                                     F                                
It's feeling like we never coming down
   
Till' we want to
                       C
But why would we want to (night)?


[Bridge:]

  C                      
When we're so close to heaven
      G                             F                          
Underneath the moonlight, it's paradise
                           Dm
It's gonna be too hard to say
           C
Goodnight yeah


[Chorus x4:]

  C                                       G
It's feeling like we' re high above the ground
                                    F
It's feeling like we never coming down
          
Till' we want to
                       C
But why would we want to (night)?

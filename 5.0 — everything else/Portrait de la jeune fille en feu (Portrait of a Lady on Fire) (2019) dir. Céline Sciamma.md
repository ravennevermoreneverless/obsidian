how can something so simple be so perfect? it might seem ironic but this film is drowning in subtleties that it's almost suffocating—but in a somehow calming way. 

i've always been fond of the story of orpheus and eurydice; it's my favorite greek myth. it's always so tragic everytime i read it, i've always seen it as orpheus not having much of a choice against his heart's desire, and so he looks back because he loves eurydice too much and he's afraid that she's not really there. this film made me look at it in a different perspective. i know the film paints mariane as orpheus and héloïse as eurydice but i see it as both of them being these characters simultaneously. 

marianne paints héloïse every chance she gets, to keep her in memory—marianne at this point was **the lover**. and in this way, héloïse knows how much these memories are valuable to marianne, and so she lets her paint her portraits. on the contrary, even though she let marianne give her a self-portrait, héloïse doesn't need concrete reminders of marianne, she remembers her in music and in the present—héloïse at this point was **the poet**. 

near the end, things suddenly changed. marianne decided to face the music and accept the tragic reality they are in, she turned around and let go—she made **the poet's choice**. at the theater hall, with vivaldi's "the four seasons" playing as a painfully sweet reminder of their love (and also one of the best acting performances of all time), marianne saw héloïse for the last time. i strongly believe héloïse knew marianne was there, it's just that she decided to bask in their memories and feel all of the emotions at once through the musical piece instead of facing her—she made **the lover's choice**. 

no matter how much i love music, when it comes to something crazy as romance, silence is something i treasure so much. i can't even begin to explain how powerful silence can be compared to music, at least for me. this film did wonders on utlizing that, and that's one of the major reasons why this is beautifully made. 

i can't help but notice how awfully familiar this film makes me feel, even though i've never really been in love before. maybe this is how my past life came about lol.

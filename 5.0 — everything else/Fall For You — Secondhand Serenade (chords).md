[Verse 1]
    Am                                        F
The best thing about tonight’s that we’re not fighting
            C                               G
It couldn't be that we have been this way before
  Am                             F
I know you don’t think that I am trying
  C                                    G
I know you’re wearing thin down to the core

[Chorus]
    F         G
But hold your breath
          C                                   Am
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       F
Over again
                       G
Don’t make me change my mind
        C
I won’t live to see another day
  Am
I swear it’s true
          F                              G
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
                      Am F C G
You’re impossible to find

[Verse 2]
Am                    F
 This is not what I intended
         C                                      G
I always swore to you that I would never fall apart
Am                            F
You always thought that I was stronger
           C
I may have failed
                                G
But I have loved you from the start

[Chorus]
        F         G
Oh, but hold your breath
          C                                   Am
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       F
Over again
                       G
Don’t make me change my mind
        C
I won’t live to see another day
  Am
I swear it’s true
          F                              G
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

It's impossible

[Bridge]
   Am      F      C
So breathe in so deep
  G        Am
Breathe me in
    F         C
I’m yours to keep
    G               Am
And hold onto your words
       F         C
‘Cause talk is cheap
      G           F
And remember me tonight

When you’re asleep

[Chorus]
          C                                   Am
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       F
Over again
                       G
Don’t make me change my mind
           C
Or I won’t live to see another day
  Am
I swear it’s true
          F                              G
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

  C                                   Am
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       F
Over again
                       G
Don’t make me change my mind
        C
I won’t live to see another day
  Am
I swear it’s true
          F                              G
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
                     (C)
You’re impossible to find

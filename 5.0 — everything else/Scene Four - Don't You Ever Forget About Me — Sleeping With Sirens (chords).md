[Intro]

D D7 G Asus4 x2


[Verse]

D                      D7         G
The hardest thing I'd ever do is say goodbye
         Asus4             D      D7
and walk slowly away from you,
         G         Asus4
But I'll do it.
          D                 D7
And after all this time I shared with you,
   G                           Asus4
it seems unfair to leave with nothing more
     D           D7         G       Asus4
than blank stares, but I'll do it.
        D                    D7
If it's for the best then I wish you well,
      G                Asus4            D       D7
if it helps to say our life was a living hell,
          G                      Asus4
well then do it, then do it, then do it.


[Chorus]

D                  Em       G
Don't you ever forget about me,
         D                            Em
When you toss and turn in your sleep,
  G
I hope it's because you can't stop thinking about
    Em             (D/F#)
the reasons why you close your eyes,
  Asus4                 (A)
I haunt your dreams at night,
       D                    Em   G
So you can't stop thinking about me,
                          
don't stop thinking about me.

D D7 G Asus4 x2


[Verse]

D                              D7
Do you really think you could see this through,
    G               Asus4                D      D7
put on a smile, and wear it for someone new?
          G         Asus4
Don't you do it.
D                          D7            G
Cause I know I'm not the easiest one to love,
    Asus4          D   D7              G     Asus4
but every ounce I have, I'd invest in you.
Em                                     G
No one said love's not for taking chances.


[Chorus]

D                 Em        G
Don't you ever forget about me,
         D                             Em
When you toss and turn in your sleep,
  G
I hope it's because you can't stop thinking about
    Em             (D/F#)
the reasons why you close your eyes,
  Asus4                 (A)
I haunt your dreams at night,
       D                    Em   G
So you can't stop thinking about me,
                          
don't stop thinking about me


[Bridge]

Em                     Em-F#m*  G
 Will you take me back in the morning,
       Em                   Em-F#m   G
if I promise to never act this way again?
Em                   Em-F#m   G
 Cause I'm so bad at being lonely,
                 Em       Em-F#m    G
but I don't know how, I don't know how.

         D           Em       G
So don't you ever forget about me,
      D           Em        G
don't you ever forget about me.


[Chorus]

D                 Em        G
Don't you ever forget about me,
         D                             Em
When you toss and turn in your sleep,
  G
I hope it's because you can't stop thinking about
    Em             (D/F#)
the reasons why you close your eyes,
  Asus4                 (A)
I haunt your dreams at night,
       D                    Em   G
So you can't stop thinking about me,
                          
don't stop thinking about me
       D  D/F#  Asus4                 G
Just close your eyes and fall asleep tonight.

*When there's a hyphen, "-", between two chords like that (Em-F#m), I'm using it 
as a hammer-on, so just barre Em and hammer on the two fingers to make F#m.

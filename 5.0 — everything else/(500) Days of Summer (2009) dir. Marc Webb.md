i hate it. 

i hate this film so much.

i hate it because of how much it made me uncomfortable for how unnecessarily relatable tom is to my life. 

this film truly hits different especially when you know what it feels like to be a hopeless romantic, thinking there's only one person, a soulmate, in the world that will ever make you happy and you will meet them by fate. you are in love with the idea of love, and once you meet someone that you **think** is "the one", then you will latch onto it like a koala to a tree. it will make you crazy, it will make you nuts, it will make you feel like a completely different person and there ain't no one else in the world that will make you feel the same—you refuse to believe there ever will be. you put this person on a pedestal, treating them like a person without flaws and that this person will complete you. but once you lose that person, you **lose** your whole self. 

they both played a part on why it didn't work; tom ignored all the signs of how summer isn't exactly what he was looking for and unintentionally believed he alone could change that because he didn't want to let go of this and on the other hand, summer made a point that she wasn't looking for a relationship but she shouldn't expect to be in a kind of relationship like that with tom fully knowing tom wants more than that. but relationships are messy like that. 

the ending could be interpreted in two ways; a positive one and a negative. **one**, is that tom finally learned that the idea of love in books, songs, movies and literature are just overly-romanticized and that it doesn't represent the true meaning of love and **two**, is that he entered another cycle identical to the 500 days of summer and he's gonna go through the whole process all over again. 

it's funny because there were too many connections and coincidences from this film relating to my life and i couldn't take it. it's literally a personal attack. i hate it so much i love it. 

side note: the soundtrack for me is the cherry on top of this whole film. 

side side note: if a girl doesn't listen to a mixtape you made specifically for her, she ain't the one.

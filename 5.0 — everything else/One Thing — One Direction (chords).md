[Intro]

C   G   C


[Verse 1]

C          G          C
I've tried playing it cool
C            G          Am
But when I'm looking at you
Am      G       C
I can't ever be brave
       C           G     C
'Cause you make my heart race


[Verse 2]

C       G          C
Shot me out of the sky
C         G     Am
You're my kryptonite
Am          G         C
You keep me making me weak
      C          G     C
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe


[Pre-Chorus]

F                       C
Something's gotta give now
           Am                      G
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
       F                      C
That I need you here with me now
       F              G    C
'Cause you've got that one thing


[Chorus]

   C                     G         Am
So get out, get out, get out of my head
     Am               G   C
And fall into my arms instead
C                        G           Am
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Am          G     C
But I need that one thing
     Am             G   C
And you've got that one thing

C   G   C


[Verse 3]

C        G            C
Now I'm climbing the walls
    C         G         Am
But you don't notice at all
Am       G               C
That I'm going out of my mind
C           G   C
All day and all night


[Pre-Chorus]

F                       C
Something's gotta give now
           Am                      G
'Cause I'm dying just to know your name
      F                      C
And I need you here with me now
       F               G   C
'Cause you've got that one thing


[Chorus]

   C                     G         Am
So get out, get out, get out of my head
    Am                G   C
And fall into my arms instead
C                       G            Am
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Am          G   C
But I need that one thing


[Chorus]

   C                     G         Am
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
     Am                G  C
And come on, come into my life
C                       G            Am
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
Am              G    C
But I need that one thing
     C              G    C
And you've got that one thing

C   G   x3


[Pre-Chorus]

C               G    C
You've got that one thing
C                     G         Am
Get out, get out, get out of my head
    Am                G C
And fall into my arms instead


[Chorus 1]

   C                     G         Am
So get out, get out, get out of my head
    Am                G C
And fall into my arms instead
C                       G            Am
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Am          G   C
But I need that one thing


[Chorus 2]

   C                     G         Am
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
    Am                 G  C
And come on, come into my life
C                       G            Am
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Am          G   C
But I need that one thing
    C               G   C
And you've got that one thing

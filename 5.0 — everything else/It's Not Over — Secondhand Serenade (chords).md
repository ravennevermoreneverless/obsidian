[Verse 1]

   E
My tears run down like razorblades
    B
And no, I'm not the one to blame
     C#m          A
It's you or is it me?
    E
And all the words we never say
     B
Come out and now we're all ashamed
    C#m
And there's no sense in playing games
            A
When you've done all you can do


[Chorus]

             E          B               C#m
But now it's over, it's over, why is it over?
   A
We had the chance to make it
         E          B                 C#m
Now it's over, it's over, it can't be over
  A
I wish that I could take it back
         E   B   C#m   A
But it's over


[Verse 2]

  E
I lose myself in all these fights
  B
I lose my sense of wrong and right
  C#m    A
I cry, I cry
     E                                  B
It's shaking from the pain that's in my head
                           C#m
I just wanna crawl into my bed
                          A
And throw away the life I led

But I won't let it die, but I won't let it die


[Chorus]

             E          B               C#m
But now it's over, it's over, why is it over?
   A
We had the chance to make it
         E          B                 C#m
Now it's over, it's over, it can't be over
  A                                     F#m
I wish that I could take it back


[Bridge]

F#m          A                  E
I'm falling apart, I'm falling apart

Don't say this won't last forever
F#m                A                         E
You're breaking my heart, you're breaking my heart
              B                  F#m  A
Don't tell me that we will never be together
         E
We could be, over and over
         F#m    A      B
We could be, forever

F#m          A                  E
I'm falling apart, I'm falling apart

Don't say this won't last forever
F#m (pause)        A (pause)                 E
You're breaking my heart, you're breaking my heart
              B                  F#m  A
Don't tell me that we will never be together
         E
We could be, over and over
         F#m    A      B
We could be, forever


[Chorus/Outro]

         E              B                C#m
It's not over, it's not over, it's never over
  A
Unless you let it take you
         E              B              C#m
It's not over, it's not over, it's not over
  A
Unless you let it break you
         E
It's not over

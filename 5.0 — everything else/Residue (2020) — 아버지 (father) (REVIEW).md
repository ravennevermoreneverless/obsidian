![[Residue (2020) — 아버지 (father).png]]

a ***Low Level of Despair***, something that you can't cry out to feel better. something that looms in the background like a low humming of a refrigerator. you only notice it at night when everyone's asleep. this being the first track really sets you in that headspace and a somber mood. ***When Your World Collapses*** sounds like what city lights look like when you have astigmatism, except the colors are all the same and it presses deep on to the back of your eyeballs. you can almost feel it in your chest, too-it's one long deep hum, with occasional synths that changes the course of the track, then comes back to humming. ***Like Nothing Changed*** is really just a continuation of the previous track but this time cold and distant. how can everyone act like everything's normal? it's like they forgot how much they hurt you. nothing changed, even if it's supposed to. they gave you ***False Hope***. they already said sorry but sorry doesn't cut it. the deep humming turned into what sounds like grumbling, now paired with hopeful undertones. the darkness is still there, but you cling onto something still, despite everything that's happened. now we're back to some kind of ***Normalcy***. single notes on the piano are pressed and drawn out, mostly on the farthest left side. with pings of signal sounds like a heat signature detected from inside of a submarine. life goes on but secretly you want to just run away and never come back. you know it's all false. you'll never have peace if you choose to stay. ***Hours Tick By*** and you're still in the same space, the same place as you were for the past decade, nothing's moving, it's just stagnant bouts of noises ringing in your head, urging you to just do something. ***In The Garden*** makes you feel like you're all alone, in a world that you've been forced into living in. something that sounds like a windpipe plays a tune, a repeating cruel one, but despite everything, all the despair and loneliness, there is a new ***World To Come***, there always will be. it might not be what you're hoping for, but it'll change, it'll be different. clips of cut singing voices play alongside the ringing sounds, like that of a rattle snake's tail. it will get better.

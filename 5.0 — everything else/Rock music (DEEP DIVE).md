1. ***Rock Around the Clock*** (1954) (single) — *Bill Haley* : first rock and roll track to enter the billboard's main sales and opened the world to this genre • <span style="color:#831100">this seems very fitting for something of a start of the rock genre, don't you think?</span>
2. ***Move It*** (1959) (single) — *Cliff Richard* : ushered in the sound of British rock • <span style="color:#831100">you might not notice it but this does sound british at times but it's still reminiscent of the US-based rock & roll influences</span>
3. ***Wild One*** (1958) (single) — *John O'Keefe* : was one of the earliest Australian rock and roll hits • <span style="color:#831100">hip and jiggy, country music and blues influences, made to be popular — I guess Australia already had this idea, not sure if it became widely spread</span> 
4. ***Rock Island Line*** (1955) (single) — *Lonnie Donegan* : was a ==major== influence and helped to develop and form a unique sound of small bands who play rock and roll like *John Lennon*'s ***Quarrymen*** (later on *The Beatles*) • <span style="color:#831100">extremely fast-paced and it really makes you dance. it sticks to your head like glue, no wonder why this helped develop the sound of future rock and roll</span>
5. ***Surfin'*** (1961) (single) — *The Beach Boys* : reached Billboard top 100 and helped solidify the surf music craze • <span style="color:#831100">oh i can definitely hear the soon-will-emerge british rock bands after the british invasion, like The Beatles, the vocal harmonizations and acapella-like runs</span>
6. ***Please Please Me*** (1963) — *The Beatles* • <span style="color:#831100">it doesn't sound so bad actually i thought a beatles record would be too overrated for me but there are some good tracks here surprisingly</span>

8. ***Sugar and Spice*** (1963) — *The Searchers* • <span style="color:#831100">oh this is something i'd unironically listen to while on a road trip somewhere on the countryside by the time summer arrives</span> 
	- Don't Cha Know
9. ***I Want to Hold Your Hand*** (1963) — *The Beatles* : was their first number one hit on the Billboard top 100 • <span style="color:#831100">no wonder this became a hit, it's very "common listener" friendly and it has a replayable value in it — really catchy</span>
10. ***You Were Mad For Me*** (1964) — *Freddie & The Dreamers* • <span style="color:#831100">listening to this while playing roblox grow a garden seems surreal</span>

14. ***The Five Faces of Manfred Mann*** (1964) — *Mandred Mann* • <span style="color:#831100">it's not much of a commendable record. i could understand if it was just one of the records that got released as soon as the genre was starting to bloom</span>

1. ***Rock Around the Clock*** (1954) (single) — *Bill Haley* : first rock and roll track to enter the billboard's main sales and opened the world to this genre • *this seems very fitting for something of a start of the rock genre, don't you think?*
2. ***Move It*** (1959) (single)  by Cliff Richard : ushered in the sound of British rock • *you might not notice it but this does sound british at times but it's still reminiscent of the US-based rock & roll influences*
3. ***Wild One*** (1958) (single) by John O'Keefe : was one of the earliest Australian rock and roll hits • *hip and jiggy, country music and blues influences, made to be popular — I guess Australia already had this idea, not sure if it became widely spread* 
4. ***Rock Island Line*** (1955) (single) by Lonnie Donegan : was a ==major== influence and helped to develop and form a unique sound of small bands who play rock and roll like *John Lennon*'s ***Quarrymen*** (later on *The Beatles*) • *extremely fast-paced and it really makes you dance. it sticks to your head like glue, no wonder why this helped develop the sound of future rock and roll*
5. ***Surfin'*** (1961) — *The Beach Boys* : reached Billboard top 100 and helped solidify the surf music craze • *oh i can definitely hear the soon-will-emerge british rock bands after the british invasion, like The Beatles, the vocal harmonizations and acapella-like runs*
6. ***Please Please Me*** (1963) — *The Beatles* • *it doesn't sound so bad actually i thought a beatles record would be too overrated for me but there are some good tracks here surprisingly*

[Verse 1]

F                 G          C   Cmaj9  Am7
Bite your face to spite your nose
F                G          C   Cmaj9  Am7
Seventeen and a half years old
F          G        C      Cmaj9    Am7
Worrying about my brother finding out
             F            G            C   Cmaj9  Am7
Where's the fun in doing what you're told


[Pre-Chorus]

   F       G                 C       Cmaj9     Am7
I said yo, oh give it a rest I could persuade you
              F                G                         C         Cmaj9     Am7
I'm not your typical stoned eighteen year old give me a night I'll make you
               F                            G                        C     Cmaj9   Am7
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age but girl I'm not your saviour
  F              G         C*
Wrestle to the ground, god help me now


[Chorus]

                       F       G            C
Because they're just girls, breaking hearts
       F       G            C
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
         F                 G             C
And she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
               F    G             C
They're just girls, they're just girls


[Verse 2]

   F              G         C   Cmaj9  Am7
A pair of frozen hands to hold
              F              G          C   Cmaj9  Am7
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
                   F                G                 C   Cmaj9  Am7
One moment I was tearing off your blouse now you're living at my house
       F               G        C   Cmaj9  Am7
What happened to just messing round


[Pre-Chorus]

        F    G                  C     Cmaj9  Am7
I said yo, think you better go, I can't take you
          F                        G                        C     Cmaj9    Am7
Yeah you sit and get stoned with thirty year olds and you think you've made it
        F                              G                         C   Cmaj9  Am7
Well shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes
  F               G        C*
Wrestle to the ground, god help me now


[Chorus]

                       F       G            C
Because they're just girls, breaking hearts
       F       G            C
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
         F                 G             C
And she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
               F    G             C
They're just girls, they're just girls


[Bridge]

   F                  G        C
I told her from the start
 F              G        C
Destined to be hard
   F                  G
I told her from the start
      C    Cmaj9  Am7
I'll break your heart
 F               G
Destined to be hard
      C    Cmaj9  Am7
I'll break your heart


[Pre-Chorus]

  F       G                 C       Cmaj9     Am7
I said yo, oh give it a rest I could persuade you
              F                G                         C         Cmaj9     Am7
I'm not your typical stoned eighteen year old give me a night I'll make you
               F                            G                        C     Cmaj9   Am7
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age but girl I'm not your saviour
  F              G         C*
Wrestle to the ground, god help me now


[Chorus]

                       F       G            C
Because they're just girls, breaking hearts
       F       G            C
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
         F                 G             C
And she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
               F    G             C
They're just girls, they're just girls
                   F       G            C
Yeah they're just girls, breaking hearts
       F       G            C
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
         F                 G             C
And she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
               F    G             C
They're just girls, they're just girls

[Intro]
C  F  G    x2


[Verse 1]
            C    F
You're insecure
                 G
Don't know what for
                C              F                 G
You're turning heads when you walk through the door

                C   F
Don't need make up
         G
To cover up
           C            F       G
Being the way that you are is enough


[Pre-Chorus]
C        F            Am       G
Everyone else in the room can see it
C        F         G
Everyone else but you


[Chorus]
           C           F            G
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
              C             F           G
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
               C             F             Am      G
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
            C   N.C.
You don't know (oh oh)
Am                     G
You don't know you're beautiful
C        F           G
If only you saw what I can see
              C          F           G
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
               C          F         Am      G
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
           C       F
You don't know (oh oh)
Am                     G
You don't know you're beautiful
C     F
Oh oh oh
N.C.                   G
That's what makes you beautiful

C  F  Am  G


[Verse 2]
           C   F
So c-come on
             G
You got it wrong
              C          F        G
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
              C    F
I don't know why
              G
You're being shy
           C          F             G
And turn away when I look into your ah-ah-eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
C        F            Am       G
Everyone else in the room can see it
C        F         G
Everyone else but you


[Chorus]
           C           F            G
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
              C             F           G
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
               C             F             Am      G
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
            C   N.C.
You don't know (oh oh)
Am                     G
You don't know you're beautiful
C        F           G
If only you saw what I can see
              C          F           G
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
               C          F         Am      G
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
           C       F
You don't know (oh oh)
Am                      G
You don't know you're beautiful
C     F
Oh oh oh
N.C.                   G
That's what makes you beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
             F                          Gsus4
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
                 F                            G
But you when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
          Am
You don't know (oh oh)
D
You don't know you're beautiful


[Chorus]
           C           F            G
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
              C             F           G
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
               C             F             Am      G
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
           C       F
You don't know (oh oh)
Am                     G
You don't know you're beautiful
C        F           G
If only you saw what I can see
              C          F           G
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
               C          F         Am      G
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

You don't know you're beautiful

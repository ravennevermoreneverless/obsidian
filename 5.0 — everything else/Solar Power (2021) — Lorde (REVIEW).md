![[Solar Power (2021) â€” Lorde.jpg]]

after 4 years of waiting, of course fans would expect another phenomenal release-something at the same level or better than the two previous albums. but when people expect too much, their opinions will be clouded by their disappointment to the point they can't tell the difference if the music is garbage or if it's just different.

however, with that being said, ***solar power*** is both.

lorde tries to capture a totally different contrasting feeling compared to the intensity of ***pure heroine*** and ***melodrama***. too bad it kinda fell short of brilliance and substance. even if i'm someone who haven't listened to her previous albums, i would think this is mediocre. this could be one of those albums where it gets better if you've listened to it multiple times, but even just listening to it twice makes me not want to listen to it again, there will always be bad records at some point in artists' careers. this must be lorde's.

edit: after another re-listen:

first track ***the path*** lorde immediately tells us she can't be your jesus and she is not your savior. and then second ***track comes solar power*** where she says "i'm kind of like a prettier jesus" (in contrast to the opening track, this is interpreted as a way of making fun of the fans saying she's their savior), ***the man with the axe*** lorde wanted to incorporate a cocteau twins-esque sound which i can distinguish with the fuzzy chords and ethereal voice effects and high falsetto notes. it's a little funny how it suddenly transitions to the reggae-ish fun, summer vibe of dominoes.

anyways, the rest of the album is completely forgettable (well, except for ***big star*** because that's about her dog and ***mood ring*** for some reason) but yeah. a little odd of a switch from synthpop to folk- pop but i guess it means she's in a different phase of her life now. 2017 melodramatic Lorde is no more.

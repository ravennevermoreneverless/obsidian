brie larson's voice is very chic and pairs well with the song as it makes it a bit more modernized. it's not very loud and aggressive, or even powerful, but it has a certain kind of sophistication which makes it more pleasant to listen to the more you listen to the song. the song itself is already addictiveâ€”it has catchy lyrics and melody, not pop-wise, but something that is easy to follow and sing along to; something to sing out loud in a shower or at a karaoke. not very rock-ish to have a bit of a head bang session, but rock enough to have a tasteful serving of slamming electric guitars as it mostly does down strokes and steady drum sequences that doesn't stray further from the script. the pre-chorus kind of does this "tip-toeing" with the syllables which plays well for a chorus build-up. during the post-chorus(es), the melody dives into a kind of bittersweet feeling of reminiscences, accompanied by a "we won, at long last, but it's the end" type of guitar riffs. there's an entire 1 minute and 17 seconds section by the end of the song without any vocals and i feel like it just solidifies that nostalgic feeling this song evokes as the song fades into a gentle end with only guitar static for the last 26 seconds. adding the "*oh yeah?*"s at the beginning brings more justice to the actual scene in the scott pilgrim film. easily the best song in the film, i don't think i'll get tired of listening to this.

> You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again

> I'll send you my love on a wire
> Lift you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh
> From you

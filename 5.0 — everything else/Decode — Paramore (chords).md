Capo 1


[Intro]

Am F


[Verse 1]

F                         Dm
  How can I decide what’s right
                           Am
when you’re clouding up my mind

I can’t win your losing
Em
fight all the time
F                           Dm
  Nor can I ever own what’s mine
                          Am
when you’re always taking sides

But you won’t take away
   Em                 F     Dm
my pride, no not this time
         Am Em
Not this time


[Chorus]

F
  How did we get here
Dm
  When I used
            Am   Em
to know you so well
F
  But how did we get here
Dm             Am Em
  I think I know


[Interlude]

Am G  Em
     (sudden stop)


[Verse 2]

F
  The truth is hiding in your
Dm
eyes and it’s hanging
        Am
on your tongue
                   Em
Just boiling in my blood
                           F
but you think that I can’t see

What kind of man that you
Dm                     Am
are if you’re a man at all

Well, I will figure
         Em        F Dm
this one out on my own
                         Am
I’m screaming I love you so
Em
  My thoughts you can’t decode


[Chorus]

F
  How did we get here
Dm
  When I used
            Am    Em
to know you so well
F
  But how did we get here
Dm             Am Em
  I think I know


[Solo]

F Dm Am Em 
F Dm Am Em 


[Bridge]

       F              Dm
Do you see what we’ve done

We’re gonna make such
Am         Em
fools of ourselves
       F              Dm
Do you see what we’ve done

We’re gonna make such
Am        Em
fools of ourselves


[Interlude]

F Dm Am Em


[Chorus]

F
  How did we get here
Dm
  When I still
         Am    Em
love you so yeah  yeah
F
  How did we get here
Dm
  When I still
         Am Em
love you so


[Outro]

          F  G  Dm Am C
I think I know
F  Am  Em          F  G  Dm  Am C
           I think I know
F  Am  Fm F     G Dm      Am C
            There is  something
F Am Em
I  see in you
F G    Dm    Am C
It might kill me
  F      Am   Em  Dm (hold)
I want it to be true

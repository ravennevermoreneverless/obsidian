[Intro]
A       C#m  G#m  x2

[Verse 1]
A
   What doesn't kill you
C#m                         G#m
   Makes you wish you were dead
      A
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
C#m             G#m
   And I can't take
          A
One more moment of this silence
           C#m              G#m
The loneliness is haunting me
        A                                               C#m  G#m
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
   A
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
C#m                       G#m
Hold my breath and let it bury me
    A
I'm not okay and it's not alright
          C#m                        G#m
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again

[Chorus]
A                  C#m
   Who will fix me now?
G#m              A
Dive in when I'm down?
               C#m
Save me from myself
      G#m    A
Don't let me drown
                 C#m
Who will make me fight?
G#m          A
Drag me out alive?
               C#m
Save me from myself
      G#m    A
Don't let me drown

[Verse 2]
A
   What doesn't destroy you
C#m                      G#m
   Leaves you broken instead
      A
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
C#m             G#m
   And I can't take
         A
One more moment of this silence
           C#m              G#m
The loneliness is haunting me
        A                                               C#m  G#m
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
   A
It comes in waves, I close my eyes
C#m                       G#m
Hold my breath and let it bury me
    A
I'm not okay and it's not alright
          C#m                        G#m
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again

[Chorus]
A                  C#m
   Who will fix me now?
G#m              A
Dive in when I'm down?
               C#m
Save me from myself
      G#m    A
Don't let me drown
                 C#m
Who will make me fight?
G#m          A
Drag me out alive?
               C#m
Save me from myself
      G#m
Don't let me

  Cm                       
I heard a knock upon my door the other day,
   Ab
I opened it to find death staring in my face,
   Cm
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates,
   Ab                                     Bb
Everywhere I go I drag this coffin just in case.

  Cm - Ab - Cm - Ab - Bb

  Cm
My bodies tremblin' sends shivers down my spine,
  Ab
Adrenaline kicks in shifts into overdrive,
  Cm
Your secrets keep you sick your lies keep you alive,
  Ab                                               Bb
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice,

  Cm
I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down,
  Ab
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house,
  Cm
I wrestle with my thoughts I shook the hand of doubt,
  Ab                                               Bb
Running from my past I'm praying feet don't fail me now!


   Eb
I've lost my god damn mind,
   Cm
It happens all the time,
   Gm              
I can't believe I'm 
   Ab       Bb
Actually, meant to be 
   Eb
Here,trying to consume,
   Cm
The drug in me is you
   Gm                  Ab
And I'm so high on misery
  Bb
Can't you see!


  Cm
I got these questions always running through my head,
  Ab
So many things that I would like to understand,
  Cm
If we are born to die and we all die to live,
  Ab                                               Bb
Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?

  Cm
I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down,
  Ab
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house,
  Cm
I wrestle with my thoughts I shook the hand of doubt,
  Ab                                            Bb
Running from my past I'm praying feet don't fail me now!


   Eb
I've lost my god damn mind,
   Cm
It happens all the time,
   Gm              
I can't believe I'm 
   Ab       Bb
Actually, meant to be 
   Eb
Here,trying to consume,
   Cm
The drug in me is you
   Gm                  Ab
And I'm so high on misery
  Bb
Can't you see!

[Verse]

G                A
Manage me, I'm a mess
       D                       G
Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
             G                              A
I want to be laughed at, laughed with, just because
               D                              G
I want to feel weightless, and that should be enough


[Refrain]

G
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
A
Waiting on a second hand pick-me-up
        D            G
And I'm over getting older
G
If I could just find the time
A
Then I would never let another day go by
    D
I'm over getting old


[Chorus]

                 G
Maybe its not my weekend,
D                   A
But its gonna be my year,
               G                          D
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
        A
As I go nowhere
               Bm
And this is my reaction
A               G
To everything I fear
                        G
'cause I've been going crazy
                A                    D
I don't want to waste another minute here


[Verse]

G                    A
Make believe, that I impress
           D                      G
That every word by design turns a head
             G                                A
I wanna feel reckless, wanna live it up, just because
               D                               G
I want to feel weightless, cause that would be enough,


[Refrain]

G
If I could just find the time
A
Then I would never let another day go by
    D
I'm over getting old


[Chorus]

                 G
Maybe its not my weekend,
D                   A
But its gonna be my year,
               G                          D
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
        A
As I go nowhere
               Bm
And this is my reaction
A               G
To everything I fear,
                        G
'cause I've been going crazy,
                A                    D
I don't want to waste another minute here,


[Middle 8]

Bm            G               D
This could be all I've waited for
Bm            G                A
This could be everything and I don't want to dream anymore,
D                                  A
Maybe its not my weekend, but it's gonna be my year
                     G                  D
And I've been going crazy, I'm stuck in here


[Chorus]

                 G
Maybe its not my weekend,
D                   A
But its gonna be my year,
               G                          D
I'm so sick of watching while the minutes pass
        A
As I go nowhere
               Bm
And this is my reaction
A               G
To everything I fear,
                        G
'cause I've been going crazy,
                A                    D
I don't want to waste another minute here,

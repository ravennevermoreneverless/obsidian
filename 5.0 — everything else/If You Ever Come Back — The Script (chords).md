[Verse 1]

          G                               D
If you're standing with your suitcase

But you can't step on the train
C
Everything's the way that you left it I still haven't slept yet

              G                        D
And if you're covering your face now

But you just can't hide the pain
 C
Still setting two plates on the counter but eating without 'cha

       G                          D
If the truth is you're a liar

When you say that you're okay
C
I'm sleepin on your side of the bed goin' out of my head now

              G                            D
And if you're out there try'na move on

But somethin' pulls you back again
C
I'm sitting here try'na persuade you like your in the same room


[Pre-Chorus]

       Em                                   G
And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder
       D                                 Bm
And I wish you could still give me a hard time
       Em                              G
And I wish I could still wish it was over
            D
But even if wishing is a waste of time
Even if I never cross your mind


[Chorus]

               G
I'll leave the door on the latch
                             D
If you ever come back if you ever come back
               C
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
       C
If you ever come back
              G
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
            D
And it will be just like you were never gone
              C
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
       C                                          G
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
          D                                         C
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back now


[Verse 2]

         G                         D
Now they say I'm wasting my time

'Cause you're never commin home
C
But they used to say the world was flat but how wrong was that now

       G                       D
And by leavin' my door open

I'm risking everythin' I own
C
There's nothin' I can lose in a break-in that you haven't taken


[Pre-Chorus]

       Em                                   G
And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder
       D                                 Bm
And I wish you could still give me a hard time
       Em                              G
And I wish I could still wish it was over
            D
But even if wishing is a waste of time
Even if I never cross your mind


[Chorus]

               G
I'll leave the door on the latch
                             D
If you ever come back if you ever come back
               C
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
       C
If you ever come back
              G
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
            D
And it will be just like you were never gone
              C
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
       C                                          G
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
          D                                         C
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back now


[Bridge]

            D                            Am
If it's the fighting you remember or the little things you miss
   D                                 Am
I know you're out there somewhere so just remember this
            D                            Am
If it's the fighting you remember or the little things you miss
Oh just remember this, oh just remember this


[Chorus]

               G
I'll leave the door on the latch
                             D
If you ever come back if you ever come back
               C
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
       C
If you ever come back
              G
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
            D
And it will be just like you were never gone
              C
There'll be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
       C                                          G
If you ever come back if you ever come back now
          D                                         C
Oh if you ever come back if you ever come back now


[Outro]

            G
And it will be just like you were never gone
            D
And it will be just like you were never gone
            C
And it will be just like you were never gone
                                                 G-D-C
If you ever come back if you ever come back now

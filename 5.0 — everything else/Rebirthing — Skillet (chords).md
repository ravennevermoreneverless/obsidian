[Intro]
C#m D#m E B A D#m E
C#m D#m E B A D#m E
C#m E 
C#m E

[Verse]
C#m                     B     A   C#m
I lie here paralytic inside this soul
C#m                         B       A C#m
Screaming for you till my throat is numb
C#m
I wanna break out
C#m
I need a way out
B                          A   
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
C#m
The worst is the waiting
B                 A 
In this womb I'm suffocating

[Pre-Chorus]
             G#m                              A          
Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen
            B (hold)
I take you in
     G#m A B
I've di--i-ied

[Chorus]
  C#m       F#m
Rebirthing now
        E                    B
I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me
 A               C#m              B           A
(Breathe for the first time now I've come alive somehow)
  C#m       F#m
Rebirthing now
          E                  B 
I wanna live my life wanna give you everything
A                 C#m             B           A           G#m A
(Breathe for the first time now I've come alive somehow)
          C#m D#m
Right now
          C#m D#m 
Right now 

[Verse]
C#m                     B   A C#m
I lie here lifeless in this cocoon
C#m                        B     A   C#m
Shedding my skin cause I'm ready to
C#m
I wanna break out
C#m
I found a way out
B                          A
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
C#m
The worst is the waiting
B                 A
In this womb I'm suffocating

[Pre-Chorus]
             G#m                              A          
Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen
            B (hold)
I take you in
     G#m A B
I've di--i-ied

[Chorus]
  C#m       A
Rebirthing now
        E                    B
I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me
C#m              A              E           B
(Breathe for the first time now I've come alive somehow)
  C#m       A
Rebirthing now
          E                  B 
I wanna live my life wanna give you everything
C#m               A             E           B           G#m A
(Breathe for the first time now I've come alive somehow)

[Bridge]
C#m 
Tell me when I'm gonna live again
C#m
Tell me when I'm gonna breathe you in
C#m
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside
C#m
Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive

A                        C#m
Tell me when I'm gonna live again
B                 A
Tell me when this fear will end
C#m              B
Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside
A                   G#m   A  
Tell me when I'll feel alive

G#m A
G#m A
G#m A B

[Chorus]
  C#m       A
Rebirthing now
        E                    B
I wanna live for love wanna live for you and me
C#m              A              E           B
(Breathe for the first time now I've come alive somehow)
  C#m       A
Rebirthing now
          E                  B 
I wanna live my life wanna give you everything
C#m               A             E           B             G#m          A
(Breathe for the first time now I've come alive somehow) (I've come alive somehow)

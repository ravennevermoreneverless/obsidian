[Intro]
Bm D Bm D G D/F# G D A/C# Em F#  x2


[Verse 1]
Bm
  if I'm a bad person
you don't like me
i guess I'll 
make my own way
Em
  it's a circle
a mean cycle
G
  I can't excite you anymore
Bm
  where's your gavel? your jury?
what's my offense this time?
Em
  you're not a judge 
but if you're gonna judge me
G
  well sentence me to another life


[Refrain 1]
Bm
  don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
when you swear it's all my fault
cause you know we're not the 
Em      
same we're not the same
   G
oh we're not the same
Bm
  the friends who stuck together
we wrote our names in blood
but i guess you can't accept 
                   Em
that the change is good
                         G   Em Em G
it's good it's good it's good

[Verse 2]
Bm
  This is the best thing 
that could've happened
any longer and i 
wouldn't have made it
Em
  it's not a war no
it's not a rapture
G
  I'm just a person 
but you can't take it
Bm
  the same tricks that 
once fooled me
they won't get 
you anywhere
Em
  I'm not the same kid 
from your memory
G
  now I can fend for myself

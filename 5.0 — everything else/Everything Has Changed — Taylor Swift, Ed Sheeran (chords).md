[Intro]
E Esus4 E Esus4 E                             


[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
         C#m7                     Asus2
All I knew this morning when I woke
                       Bsus4
Is I know something now, know something now 
               E
I didn't before
                C#m7               Asus2
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago 
                         
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile in
    Bsus4                               
The back of my mind making me feel like


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
E                                  F#m7                            Asus2
 I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
                                   C#m7             Bsus4              
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
E                                  F#m7                            Asus2
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
                          C#m7       Bsus4
 I just want to know you, know you, know you


[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
      E                           
Cause all I know is we said hello
    C#m7                                
And your eyes look like coming home 
  Bsus4                     Asus2
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
E
All I know is you held the door
C#m7
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
  Bsus4                      Asus2
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed


[Instrumental]
E Esus4 E Esus4 E


[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran + Taylor Swift]
            C#m7                         Asus2
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
                        Bsus4                               
But I'll take them down, take them down 
                             E      
And open up the door for you
            C#m7                           Asus2
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies 

The beautiful kind, making up for lost time 
Bsus4 
    Taking flight, making me feel like


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
E                                  F#m7                            Asus2
 I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
                                   C#m7             Bsus4              
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
E                                  F#m7                            Asus2
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
                          C#m7       Bsus4
 I just want to know you, know you, know you


[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
      E                           
Cause all I know is we said hello
    C#m7                                
And your eyes look like coming home 
  Bsus4                     Asus2
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
E
All I know is you held the door
C#m7
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
  Bsus4                      Asus2
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed


[Bridge: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
C#m7                  Asus2
  Come back and tell me why
                      E                      Bsus4
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
   C#m7                 Asus2
Ahhh And meet me there tonight
                     E                Bsus4
And let me know that it's not all in my mind


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
E                                  F#m7                            Asus2
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
                          C#m7       Bsus4
 I just want to know you, know you, know you

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
E
All I know is we said hello
   C#m7
So dust off your highest hopes
Bsus4                        
All I know is pouring rain
Asus2
 And everything has changed
E
All I know is a new found grace
C#m7
All my days, I'll know your face
Bsus4                     Asus2
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed

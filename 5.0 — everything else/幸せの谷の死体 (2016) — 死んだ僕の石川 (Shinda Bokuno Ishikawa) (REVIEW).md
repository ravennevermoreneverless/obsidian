![[幸せの谷の死体 (2016) — 死んだ僕の石川 (Shinda Bokuno Ishikawa).jpg]]

I was met with lots of screaming and dissonant guitar strumming and disassembled percussion. I was dragged into the entrance of a decrepit death metal gig at a downtown bar, after screaming 死にたくない fifty times, we're suddenly launched head first to some really really soft-voiced japanese indie rock-a little shoegaze-y, too-which is kind of hilarious with the contrast it has with the first two tracks. after this, ***manbik/*** comes in with a girl speaking in japanese, and the disgruntled instruments came back half-forced accompanying the monologue. then an english man speaks about submission to the silence, still with the gargle of music, lastly, with the last track, i fell in love with a cancer patient. this album doesn't really know who they are they're clinically diagnosed with BPD.

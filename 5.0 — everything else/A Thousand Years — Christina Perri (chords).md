[Verse 1]
Cadd9                       G/B
Heart beat fast, colors and promises
          Em7              D/F#      G    Cadd9
How to be brave, how can I love when I'm afraid
                          G/B
To fall, but watching you stand alone
          Em7             D/F#   G       Am
All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow
           Em  D   N.C.
  One Step Closer

[Chorus]
G                              D/F#
I have died, everyday, waiting for you
Em7                             D
Darling don't be afraid, I have loved you
      Cadd9                            Dsus4    D   N.C.
For a thousand years, I love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
          Em7               D/F#    G
I will be brave, I will not let any-thing
Cadd9                        G/B
Take away, whats standing in front of me
      Em7           D/F#      G       Am
Every breath, every hour has come to this
         Em   D    N.C.
One step closer

[Chorus]
G                              D/F#
I have died, everyday, waiting for you
Em7                             D
Darling don't be afraid, I have loved you
      Cadd9                            Dsus4    D
For a thousand years, I love you for a thousand more
    G                            D/F#
And All along I believed I would find you
Em7                                           D
Time has brought your heart to me, and I have loved you
      Cadd9                               Dsus4    D
For a thousand years, I'll love you for a thousand more

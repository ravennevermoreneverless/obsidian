[Verse 1]
A
Fucking in a car, shooting heroin
             B
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
            A
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
                B
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them

                A
And we can find out the information, access all the applications
         B
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
    A
Oh, fuck your feelings, truth is only hearsay
                   B
We're just left to decay, modernity has failed us


[Chorus 1]
                       A
And I'd love it if we made it
                        B
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
                        A
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
                        B
Yes, I'd love it if we made it


[Verse 2]
    A
And poison me daddy, I got the jones right through my bones
B
Write it on a piece of stone, a beach of drowning three year olds
A
Rest in peace Lil Peep, the poetry is in the streets
      B
Jesus save us, modernity has failed us


[Chorus 2]
                       A
And I'd love it if we made it
                        B
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
                        A
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
                        B
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

                      A       B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m                   A   B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m           A       B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m                   A   B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m
Tell me something I didn't know


[Bridge]
A
Consultation, degradation, fossil fuelling, masturbation
B
Immigration, liberal kitsch, kneeling on a pitch


[Verse 3]
        A
I moved on her like a bitch, excited to be indicted
    B
Unrequited house with seven pools, thank you Kanye, very cool
    A
The war has been incited and guess what, you're all invited
           B
And you're famous, modernity has failed us


[Outro]
                      A       B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m                   A   B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m           A       B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m                     A  B
Tell me something I didn't know
        C#m           A       B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m                   A   B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m           A       B
And I'd love it if we made it
        C#m                   A  B  C#m
And I'd love it if we made it

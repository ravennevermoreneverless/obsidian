![[Popular Monster (2024) â€” Falling in Reverse.jpg]]

he built this record around the beauty of popular monster but he milked it too dry until it turned into an amalgamation of narcissism and attention-seeking. he kept trying to recreate that song, only to result in multiple failures again and again that he's starting to sound like bojack trying to relive his horsin' around days and fighting to stay relevant. ronnie knows he's always been shitty, he's suffering in his own tower of filth, he flaunts his misery because he identifies with it. it was kind of acceptable to talk about his negative qualities and glorify it when he was still singing in the era of just like you, but now? i can't defend ronnie radke anymore, he used to make music that i really love but i'm not sure if i can still look forward to his future projects considering how much of his personality is built upon a pathetic heavily uninspired reiterating of his suffering. ***zombified*** is the only track aside from ***popular monster*** that actually sounds listenable, at least for me. still an attempt of recreation for ***popular monster*** but hey, he actually came kind of close to his goal.

this album sucks, i gave it a star just because i love the track popular monster and it should've stayed as a single.

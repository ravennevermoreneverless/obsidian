[Intro]
C   G   D   Em   x4
Em  D   G   Am7

[Verse]
Em                D                    G   Am7 
  I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
     Em               D                      G   Am7
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in 
    Em         D                 G   Am7
Cos I got time while she got freedom
    Em                  D                  G   Am7
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even

Em              D                  G    Am7
  Her best days will be some of my worst 
Em                D                  G        Am7
  She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
      Em             D                G    Am7
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
    Em                  D                  G      Am7
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no

[Chorus]
C         G                         D               Em               C
  What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you, and
        G                          D             Em              C
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're OK, yeah
G              D  Em   C
I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
G              D  Em  
I'm falling to pieces 

[Instrumental]
Em   D   G   Am7

[Verse]
     Em             D                  G   Am7    
They say bad things happen for a reason 
    Em            D                      G    Am7 
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
    Em             D                    G   Am7 
Cos she's moved on while I'm still grieving 
    Em                  D                  G     Am7  
And when a heart breaks no it don't break even (even)

[Chorus]
C         G                         D               Em              C          
  What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you, and
        G                          D             Em               C  
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're OK, yeah
G              D  Em   C 
I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
G              D  Em   C 
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
G              D  Em  
I'm falling to pieces (One still in love while the other one's leaving)
C G              D  Em  
  I'm falling to pieces (Cos when a heart breaks no it don't breakeven)

[Instrumental]
Em   D    G    Am7  x2

[Bridge]
        Em               D
You got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
G                 Am7
You took your suitcase, I took the blame
        Em               D                 G 
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains, oh
        Am7
Cos you left me with no love and no love to my name 

[Verse]
Em                D                    G   Am7 
  I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
     Em               D                      G   Am7
Just prayin' to a god that I don't believe in 
    Em         D                 G   Am7
Cos I got time while she got freedom
    Em                  D                 
Cos when a heart breaks no it don't break
G
No, it don't break
Am7                 C
No, it don't break even, no! 

[Chorus]
        G                   D               Em              C
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you, and
        G                          D             Em   
What am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up that you're OK
C G              D  Em   C  
  I'm falling to pieces, yeah 
G              D  Em   C
I'm falling to pieces, yeah (Oh, I'm falling, I'm falling... yeah)
G              D  Em  
I'm falling to pieces (One still in love while the other one's leaving)
C G              D  Em

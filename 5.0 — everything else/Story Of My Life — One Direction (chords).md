**Capo on 1st Fret**

[Verse 1: Harry & Liam]
Bm                                                    D
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
Bm                                                     D
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
Bm                                    G                            D
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
Bm                                     G                           D
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
            G     A    Bm
And I'll be gone gone tonight
                      G      A      Bm
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
                      G      A      Bm
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
                   A
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry]
       D               
The story of my life I take her home
      G                                Bm                        
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
G    D          
Is frozen the story of, the story of
D
The story of my life I give her hope.
     G                              Bm
I spend her love until she's broke inside
G                 D
The story of my life the story of, the story of

[Verse 2: Niall & Liam]
Bm                             G                      D
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Bm                             G                      D
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
Bm                              G                         D
I know that in the mornin' I'll see a single light upon a hill
Bm                         G               D
Although I am broken my heart is untamed still

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
              G     A    Bm
And I'll be gone gone tonight
                       G       A      Bm
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
                        G     A    Bm
The way that I been holdin' on so tight
                    A
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry]
      D 
The story of my life I take her home
    G                                  Bm
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
G     D
Is frozen the story of, the story of
D                          
The story of my life I give her hope
    G                               Bm
I spend her love until she's broke inside
G                 D
The story of my life the story of, the story of

[Bridge: Zayn & Niall]
              Em             G              A
And I been waiting for this time to come around
              Em          G                      A  
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

      D                           
The story of my life I take her home
     G                                   Bm
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
G     D        
Is frozen

[Chorus: All & Harry]
      D                              
The story of my life I give her hope give her hope
      G                                Bm
I spend her love until she's broke inside until she's broke inside
G                   D
The story of my life the story of, the story of
                   D             G
The story of my life
                  Bm              G
The story of my life the story of, the story of
                 D
The story of my life

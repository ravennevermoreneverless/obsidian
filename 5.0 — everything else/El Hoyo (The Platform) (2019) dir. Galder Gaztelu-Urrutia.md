now this is a movie that made me uncomfortable and think at the same time, exactly what i needed. 

the metaphor and symbolism is pretty **obvious** as you go along. it's all about how society works and the failures of capitalism. how people born with privilege gets everything while those who are not suffer; resulting in survival of the fittest. the people "above" are greedy and they'll take what they want, more than what they need, just because they can and have the power to do so. and in consequence, the people "below" gets the minimum, getting worse and worse as the hierarchy lowers which showcases how the selfishness and greediness of humanity arises as it is tested, just to survive. 

the ending was something that still makes me think and doesn't have a proper conclusion for me (which is not really a bad thing). it is possible that miharu's child doesn't exist (and her purpose on changing levels is a mystery to me) and the child on level 333 could just be goreng's hallucination as he (and baharat) were on the brink of death. they might've sent the panna cotta on level 0 successfully, which explains why in the middle of the movie, there was a scene where the head-chef was complaining about a piece of hair on the panna cotta, completely misunderstanding the supposed message (which was a sign of humanity. in solidarity, we can break the hegemony of the administration or it could be just a "fuck you") but since they were above, thinking they are doing what's best for the people below, they have no idea what it's like to be on the lowest parts of the hierarchy. 

bonus part: i think trimagasi and imoguiri serves as the angel/demon pair in goreng's hallucinations. plus, the total number of people in that place is 666, which might mean that it is a purgatory and the whole movie is an allegory on biblical aspects (the concept of belief and god was mentioned at least twice in the film) so it is a possibility. 

i've read tons of reviews about how the ending was ambiguous and there were inconsistencies but i believe they've nailed the point across. i freaking love this movie.

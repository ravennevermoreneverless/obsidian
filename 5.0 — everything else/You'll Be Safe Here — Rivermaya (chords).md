[Intro]

B F# C#m G#m F# E


[1st Stanza]

C#m
Nobody knows
               G#m F#
Just why we're here

C#m
Could it be fate
          G#m     F#
Or random circumstance
C#m
At the right place
           G#m F#
At the right time
               E
Two roads intertwine


[2nd Stanza]

C#m
And if the universe
        G#m F#
conspired
C#m
To meld our lives
           G#m       F#
To make us fuel and fire
C#m
Then know Where ever
         G#m F#
you will be
              E
So too shall I be


[Chorus 1]

           B
Close your eyes
         F#
Dry your tears
          C#m           G#m
'Coz when nothing seems clear
       F#        B
You'll be safe here
               F#
From the sheer weight
        C#m
Of your doubts and fears
       G#m
Weary heart
       F#      E
You'll be safe here


[3rd Stanza]

C#m
Remember how we laughed
              G#m F#
Until we cried
C#m
At the most stupid things
     G#m F#
Like we were so high
C#m
But love was all
               G#m F#
that we were on
        E
We belong


[4th Stanza]

C#m
And though the world would
     G#m F#
Never understand
C#m
This unlikely union
       G#m F#
And why it still stands
C#m
Someday we will
          G#m F#
be set free
         E
Pray and believe


[Chorus 2]

           B            F#
When the light disappears
               C#m           G#m
And when this world's insincere
       F#      B
You'll be safe here
      F#           C#m
When nobody hears you scream
    G#m
I'll scream with you
       F#         B
You'll be safe here


[Instrumental]

B F#  G#m A
G#m  G  F#


[Chorus 3]

          B
Save your eyes
          F#
From your tears
     C#m          G#m
When everything's unclear
       F#         B
You'll be safe here
               F#
From the sheer weight
         C#m           
Of your doubts and fears
G#m          F#
Wounded heart


[Chorus 4]

         B
When the light
F#
disappears
              C#m      G#m
And when this world's insincere
       F#       B
You'll be safe here
     F#
When nobody
          C#m
hears you scream
                   G#m
I'll scream with you
       F#         B
You'll be safe here


[Chorus 5]

       F#
In my arms
            C#m
Through the long cold night
      G#m
Sleep tight
       F#          B
You'll be safe here
        F#
When no one
        A
understands
       E
I'll believe
       F#
You'll be safe,
       B
You'll be safe
       F#          A  G#m  F#  B
You'll be safe here
         A           E
Put your heart in my hands
       Em      B
You'll be safe here

![[0 (2013) — 青葉市子 (Ichiko Aoba).jpg|300]]

it was really off to a weak start, then ***mars 2027*** came and I thought "wow this is gonna be a good track", only to be pretty disappointed in its second half with its jumbled dissonant mess. you really think the field recordings could save it but no. however, ***いりぐちでぐち*** came with its whopping size of almost 12 minutes, i could not complain about the length at all. now this is how you keep a song going. it leaves you wondering and wanting more. it's somewhat of a classic ichiko aoba track with somber mystical vocals and folk guitar playing as its accompaniment, the highlight of the song is most likely ichiko counting from 1 to 15, and then came a barrage of random animal noises-it doesn't sound as good written down and it's almost pretty silly too, but trust me, the goosebumps are real however, despite my praise of this track, I wouldn't call it the best song in here, this was just a start towards something great. ***うたのけはい*** came as a palate cleanser, it's refreshing, like the first whiff of moming air as you step outside.it was that way because ***機械仕掛乃宇宙*** came roaring towards you as a sheena ringo-esque track from ichiko aoba, very different from what we're used to. sure, it still has them guitars but it's a little bit more upbeat and fast-paced. I don't necessarily welcome this change for i am currently in the mood for something nostalgic and melancholic but this apparently is liked by most people here (due to the album's high rating average and people on the comments saying that specific track is a masterpiece), it was awfully long though, albeit the same as the other track ***いりぐちでぐち***— I am much more inclined to listen to the latter, and then we're back to classic ichiko aoba with ***四月の支度はるなつあきふゆ*** is the last track and certainly not the very least. it is emotional and i am emotional, that's it.

i can't believe this is the highest rated ichiko aoba record.

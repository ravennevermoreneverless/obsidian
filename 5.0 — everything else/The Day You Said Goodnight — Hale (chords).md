[Intro]
E - Esus4 - E
Bsus4 Asus2


[Verse 1]
        E
Take me as you are
        Bsus4        Asus2
Push me off the road
    C#m        Bsus4             Asus2
The sadness, I need this time to be with you
             E
I'm freezing in the sun
            Bsus4       Asus2
I'm burning in the rain
    C#m            Bsus4            Asus2
The silence, I'm screaming, calling out your name


[Pre-Chorus 1]
      C#m   Bsus4         Asus2
And I do reside in your light
            A6add9           Bsus4
Put out the fire with me and find
         C#m      Bsus4         Asus2
Yeah you lose the side of your circles
                 A6add9           Bsus4
That's what I'll do if we say goodbye


[Chorus 1]
   E                   Bsus4
To be is all I got to be
               A6add9
And all that I see
                Asus2
And all that I need this time
   E                     Bsus4
To be the life you gave me
                     A6add9  Emaj7  Asus2
The day you said goodnight

E - Esus4 - E
Bsus4 Asus2


[Verse 2]
             E
The calmness in your face
           Bsus4          Asus2
That I see through the night
    C#m            Bsus4              Asus2
The warmth of your light is pressing unto us
            E
You didn't ask me why
          Bsus4         Asus2
I never would have known
  C#m         Bsus4     Asus2
Oblivion is falling down


[Pre-Chorus 2]
      C#m   Bsus4         Asus2
And I do reside in your light
             A6add9           Bsus4
Put out the fire with me and find
         C#m      Bsus4          Asus2
Yeah you lose the side of your circles
                 A6add9           Bsus4
That's what I'll do if we say goodbye


[Chorus 2]
   E                   Bsus4
To be is all i got to be
               A6add9
And all that I see
                Asus2
And all that I need this time
   E                     Bsus4
To me the life you gave me
                     A6add9  Emaj7  Asus2
The day you said goodnight


[Bridge]
C#m                   Bsus4              Asus2
  If you could only know me like your prayers at night
C#m           Bsus4                A6add9        Bsus4
  Then everything between you and me will be alright


[Chorus 3]
   E                   Bsus4
To be is all I got to be
               A6add9
And all that I see
                Asus2
And all that I need this time
   E                     Bsus4
To me the life you gave me
                     A6add9  Emaj7  Asus2
The day you said goodnight


[Outro]
E                Bsus4
She's already taken,
                A6add9
She's already taken,
               Asus2
She's already taken me
E                Bsus4
She's already taken,
                A6add9
She's already taken,
               Asus2
She's already taken me

E - Esus4 - E
Bsus4 Asus2

                     A6add9  Emaj7  Asus2
The day you said goodnight...............

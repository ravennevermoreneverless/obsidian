why do i cut off people easily? is it because i'm perfectly content with my life right now in my own little world and having connection won't necessarily enrich anything? or is it because i'm afraid of being attached and to bare my soul to another human being that's why i'm this closed off? i feel like it will take me a lifetime to even figure these things out and i feel like i'll never be good enough to ever engage with people again. but am i just running away from inevitable pain? because of the fear of being hurt? am i wasting my life whilst i prepare to live? am i stopping myself from growing up yet still growing old? would i still know my real self if i just remained inside the walls or should i escape the city, return to my shadow, and face the outside with all its uncertainties and torment? right now, at this moment of my life, i have at least a year to think about it. that's how much time i'll allow myself to look at things in perspective and dive deeper.

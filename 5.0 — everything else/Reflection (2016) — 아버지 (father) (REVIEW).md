![[Reflection (2016) — 아버지 (father).jpg|250x400]]

***Reflection*** is composed of different kinds of glitchy beats that repeats every after 16 instances. i don't think there are two of the same kind that repeats twice. every sound is different. it sets out the stage for something that you can't really predict nor expect. it's like opening up a door of infinite possibilities, or entering an abandoned mall. ***Waking Up The Same*** is like hearing falling objects in that mall, seemingly unprovoked, you may or may not be alone in the building. probably one of the weaker tracks in this album, then ***Someone Else*** enters, or at least you thought someone did. an ambient sound continues to drone out along the track, until it hits a low, and a shimmer of melody jumps by just before it ends. if losing everything has a musical equivalent, then that's exactly why the track ***Loosing Everything*** is titled like that, it sounds like memories in reverse, flashing like something out of a pre-death experience. faces become blurred, the sceneries move past you like you're in a train to the next life. bouts of ambient sounds come out in gradients; quiet to loud to silence once more, your floating suddenly comes to an abrupt stop, you're back at the mall. somehow you can hear a faint distant music, pumping like a heartbeat. it's ***Sinking In***. you're reminded of the music that plays at the department store, albeit distorted, the humming is very low, almost like darkness seeping through the flashes of light. where was the light coming from? at the farthest end of the mall, you can see a bright light, and ***Voices***. it's singing to you, "come," it says. you follow the light and the voices-they kept singing and the lights appeared to dance. the humming and unintelligible singing comes again, except this time it brings a kind of hopefulness. for something titled like this, you'd expect the track to come to a higher pitched climax, something like a breakthrough-except it never comes, the catharsis you're looking for can be different from everyone else, for now, it's calm and subdued, like a soft orange sunlight through your window in the afternoon. ***Tomorrow*** comes. "take it," the light whispers softly. "but what is it for?" you ask. "it's not what you wanted but it's all you'll ever need," it replies. "now go, everyone's waiting for you." the light is stronger now at the exit of the mall, the beat is repeating, once again, but this time it ascends, with melodic high-pitched singing alongside it. for full 10 minutes it just keeps on ascending, it's like you're nearing the end, except it's not exactly the end, it looks just like a beginning, too, with your foot at the very last steps of yesterday, you take a few steps towards tomorrow, now you're given the light, it's up to you what you're going to do with the ***Untitled***. it's up to you to fill in the blanks, paint on the canvas, draw on the sheet of paper. it's yours, don't ever let go of it.

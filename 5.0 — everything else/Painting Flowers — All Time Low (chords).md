**Capo on 2nd Fret**

G                                
Strange maze, what is this place?
D 
I hear voices over my shoulder,
Em                         C
Nothing's making sense at all.
G
Wonder, why do we race?
D
When everyday we're runnin' in circles,
Em                    C
Such a funny way to fall.
G                   D
Tried to open up my eyes,
                 Em                        C            
I'm hopin' for a chance to make it alright.

             G
When I wake up,
                 D
the dream isn't done.
           Em
I wanna see your face,
                    C
and know I made it home.
                G
If nothing is true,
                 D
What more can I do?
          Em                     C
I am still painting flowers for you.

G D Em C

G
Show my cards,
                  D
Gave you my heart,
                            
Wish we could start all over. 
Em                         C   
Nothing's makin' sense at all.
G                   D
Tried to open up my eyes,
                 Em                       C
I'm hopin' for a chance to make it alright.


            G

                 D

                    C

          Em                     C
I am still painting flowers for you.


D                       Em               
I heard everything you said,
D                      Em
I don't wanna lose my head,

          G
When I wake up,
                 D
the dream isn't done.
           Em
I wanna see your face,
                    C
and know I made it home.
                G

                 D

          Em                     C
I am still painting flowers for you.
          Em                     C   G
I am still painting flowers for you.

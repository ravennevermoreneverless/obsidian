[Intro]
Em G C

[Verse 1]
C Am                    C Am                       Em
Maybe if my heart stops beating it won't hurt this much
    C Am                 C Am               Em
And never will I have to answer again to anyone
C            Am     C Am 
Please don't get me wrong, because

[Chorus]
G                    Cadd9
I'll never let this go
   Am                 Bm            Cadd9
but I can't find the words to tell you
G                  Cadd9
I don't wanna be alone
   Am                Bm            Cadd9
but now I feel like I don't know you

[Verse 2]
C Am                       C Am                       Em
One day you'll get sick of saying that everything's alright
    C Am                       C Am                     Em
and by then I'm sure I'll be pretending just like I am tonight
C             Am    C Am
please don't get me wrong, because

[Chorus]
G                    Cadd9
I'll never let this go
   Am                 Bm            Cadd9
but I can't find the words to tell you
G                  Cadd9
I don't wanna be alone
   Am                Bm            Cadd9
but now I feel like I don't know you

[Bridge]
Em G C

[Chorus]
G                    Cadd9
I'll never let this go
   Am                 Bm            Cadd9
but I can't find the words to tell you
G                  Cadd9
I don't wanna be alone
   Am                Bm            Cadd9
but now I feel like I don't know you
G                    Cadd9
I'll never let this go
   Am                 Bm             Cadd9
but I can't find the words to tell you
    Am                Bm            Cadd9
that now I feel like I don't know you

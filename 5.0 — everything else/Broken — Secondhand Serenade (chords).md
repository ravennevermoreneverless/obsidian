[Intro]

C D E


[Verse 1]

       C               D
In the moonlight, your face it glows
E                              C
Like a thousand diamonds, I suppose
         D                    E
And your hair flows like, the ocean breeze
      C                    D                E
Not a million fights could make me hate you
                                  C
You’re invincible, yeah it’s true
             D          E
It’s in your eyes where I find peace


[Chorus]

      A              D             E
Is it broken, can we work it out
                                    B
Let’s light up the town, scream out loud
      A              D             E
Is it broken, can we work it out
                                       B
I can see in your eyes you’re ready to break
(mute)         C - D - E
Don’t look away


[Verse 2]

           C            D
So here we are now in a place where
    E   E      E            C         D
The sun blends in, with the ocean thin
              E
So thin we can stand
  C                     D
Across from each other, together we’ll wonder
   E                  C
If we will last these days
     D                           E
If I asked you to stay would you tell me
                  C - D - E
You would be mine
    C       D
And time is all I ask for
E                          C - D - E
Time, I just need one more day
    A                 D
And time, you’ve been crying too long
A
Time, and your tears wrote this song
D - E - B
Stay

(soft) C               D             E
In the moonlight, your face it glows


[Chorus]

      A              D             E
Is it broken, can we work it out
                                    B
Let’s light up the town, scream out loud
      A              D             E
Is it broken, can we work it out
                                       B
I can see in your eyes you’re ready to break
(mute)         C - D - E
Don’t look away


[Outro]

C - D - E

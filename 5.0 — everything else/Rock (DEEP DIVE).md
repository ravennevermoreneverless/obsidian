- ***Rock Around the Clock*** (1954) (single) — *Bill Haley* : first rock and roll track to enter the billboard's main sales and opened the world to this genre • <span style="color:#831100">this seems very fitting for something of a start of the rock genre, don't you think?</span>
- ***Rock Island Line*** (1955) (single) — *Lonnie Donegan* : was a ==major== influence and helped to develop and form a unique sound of small bands who play rock and roll like *John Lennon*'s ***Quarrymen*** (later on *The Beatles*) • <span style="color:#831100">extremely fast-paced and it really makes you dance. it sticks to your head like glue, no wonder why this helped develop the sound of future rock and roll</span>
- ***Wild One*** (1958) (single) — *John O'Keefe* : was one of the earliest Australian rock and roll hits • <span style="color:#831100">hip and jiggy, country music and blues influences, made to be popular — I guess Australia already had this idea, not sure if it became widely spread</span> 
- ***Move It*** (1959) (single) — *Cliff Richard* : ushered in the sound of British rock • <span style="color:#831100">you might not notice it but this does sound british at times but it's still reminiscent of the US-based rock & roll influences</span>
- ***Surfin'*** (1961) (single) — *The Beach Boys* : reached Billboard top 100 and helped solidify the surf music craze • <span style="color:#831100">oh i can definitely hear the soon-will-emerge british rock bands after the british invasion, like The Beatles, the vocal harmonizations and acapella-like runs</span>
- ***Please Please Me*** (1963) — *The Beatles* • <span style="color:#831100">it doesn't sound so bad actually i thought a beatles record would be too overrated for me but there are some good tracks here surprisingly</span> 
	- Anna (Go To Him)
- ***How Do You Like It?*** (1963) *— Gerry & The Pacemakers* • <span style="color:#831100">really upbeat and energetic</span>
	- You'll Never Walk Alone
- ***Sugar and Spice*** (1963) — *The Searchers* • <span style="color:#831100">oh this is something i'd unironically listen to while on a road trip somewhere on the countryside by the time summer arrives</span> 
	- Don't Cha Know
- ***I Want to Hold Your Hand*** (1963) — *The Beatles* : was their first number one hit on the Billboard top 100 • <span style="color:#831100">no wonder this became a hit, it's very "common listener" friendly and it has a replayable value in it — really catchy</span>
- ***The Wham of That Memphis Man!*** (1963) — *Lonnie Mack* : meanwhile in the US, blues rock was already brewing, and this kickstarted some of the big influences of the rock genre • <span style="color:#831100">i never thought i'd rate another album again, let alone a 4, for christ's sake! AND after a k-pop album, too. my ears are very much cleansed. and this was the reason, a blues album. probably will be one of my blues favorites.</span>
	- Where There's a Will
	- Why
	- Down In The Dumps
- ***You Were Mad For Me*** (1964) — *Freddie & The Dreamers* • <span style="color:#831100">listening to this while playing roblox grow a garden seems surreal</span> 
	- It Doesn't Matter Anymore
	- Tell Me When
- ***Stay With the Hollies*** (1964) — *The Hollies* • <span style="color:#831100">not even mad, this is quite good</span>
	- Mr Moonlight
	- Lucille
- ***Peter and Gordon*** (1964) — *Peter and Gordon* • <span style="color:#831100">i don't know, i've been at this for weeks and i still haven't finished it so i'll just move on</span>

	- The Story of Bo Diddley
	- I'm Mad Again
- ***The Five Faces of Manfred Mann*** (1964) — *Mandred Mann* • <span style="color:#831100">it's not much of a commendable record. i could understand if it was just one of the records that got released as soon as the genre was starting to bloom</span>
- ***The Rolling Stones*** (1964) — *The Rolling Stones* • <span style="color:#831100">i mean, i can't complain: it's the rolling stones for christ's sake—i just wished it was better or up to my expectations though</span>
- ***Rubber Soul*** (1965) — *The Beatles* : main band to help internationalize rock and roll • <span style="color:#831100">it has its upsides and the lows are pretty boring</span>
- ***My Generation*** (1965) — *The Who* • <span style="color:#831100">longass album, i thought it would never end but i don't have major complaints either</span>
	- The Kids Are Alright

- ***Aftermath*** (1966) — *The Rolling Stones* • <span style="color:#831100">sounds like a really country album for the rolling stones</span>
- ***Live On Air 1966*** (1966) — *The Mindbenders* • <span style="color:#831100">it works as an album and a radio broadcast episode</span>
- ***From Nowhere*** (1966) — *The Troggs* • <span style="color:#831100">was it a typical or not-so-typical rock album? i'm not sure. my perception of rock is slowly turning intona smudge. it's just not-so-typical and typical, no in-between. what has become of me?</span>
- ***Sunshine Superman*** (1966) — *Donovan* • <span style="color:#831100">refreshing as fuck. not sure if this is even rock but it was released along those times. i very much think this would fit well as a soundtrack for lord of the rings, the hobbits' scenes and stuff—pretty nice album, bro.</span>
	- Legend of a Girl Child Linda 
	- Three King Fishers
- ***Face to Face*** (1966) — *The Kinks* • <span style="color:#831100">largely influenced by country music, i guess</span>
- ***Try Too Hard*** (1966) — *The Dave Clark Five* • <span style="color:#831100">oh a really quick one. i was contemplating whether to listen to an old album or a new one but i chose this one because it's nearer to the late 1960's which is the transition to blues rock</span>
- ***Revolver*** (1966) — *The Beatles* • <span style="color:#831100">it got me thinking 'yeah i guess this is actually the reson why the beatles became popular and what made them as big as they are now'</span>
	- Eleanor Rigby
- ***A Quick One*** (1966) — *The Who* • <span style="color:#831100">unique-sounding, excentric, totally in its own league and world, from start to finish it wanted to say something no one has ever been said and they succeeded.</span>
	- Boris The Spider
	- Barbara Ann
	- Doctor, Doctor
- ***Pet Sounds*** (1966) — *The Beach Boys* • <span style="color:#831100">they're US-based but you can clearly see the influence of british rock bands here. not necessarily full-on rock, but a dashof surf rock and a lot of fun.</span>
	- Wouldn't It Be Nice
	- I Just Wasn't Made For These Times
- ***Blonde on Blonde*** (1966) — *Bob Dylan* • <span style="color:#831100">bob dylan is a big name in the music industry but this sounds like a random country blues album from the south</span>
- ***Jefferson Airplane Takes Off*** (1966) — *Jefferson Airplane* • <span style="color:#831100">what a stupid name. jefferson airplane? what's he gonna do? take off a plane? what? haha</span>

	- Oh, Pretty Woman
	- Tears in My Eyes
- ***Between the Buttons*** (1967) — *The Rolling Stones* • <span style="color:#831100">there wasn't much hint of blues rock here from this time, probably because the bluesbreakers are still spreading their influence throughout britain and rolling stones just so happened to release an album at the same time</span>
- ***Little Games*** (1967) — *The Yardbirds* • <span style="color:#831100">i can't believe there were so many influential musicians here; eric clapton, jeff beck, jimmy page? well, well, well, rock classics. </span>
- ***Canned Heat*** (1967) — *Canned Heat* • <span style="color:#831100">blues and country influence? sounds like this came FROM an influence and not the influence themselves...</span>
- ***Big Brother & The Holding Company*** (1967) — *Big Brother & The Holding Company, Janis Joplin* • <span style="color:#831100">i was fully expecting janis joplin to be this kind of blues goddess due to nina simone but well, i guess it sounded ordinary.</span>

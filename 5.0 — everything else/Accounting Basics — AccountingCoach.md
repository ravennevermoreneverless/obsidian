## Income Statement
- shows how profitable a company is during the time interval shown in the statement's heading
#### Revenues
==Accrual basis of accounting== — records revenues as they're earned, not when the company receives money
#### Expenses
- shows expenses incurred during the time interval regardless of when the company actually paid for the expenses
==matching principle== — showing the expenses in an incme statement will result in a *matching* of the cost of the labor* with the revenues associated with it.

The difference (or "net") between the revenues and expenses is often referred to as the *bottom line* and it is labeled as either **Net Income** or **Net Loss**. 

## Balance Sheet
- reports the amount of a company's assets, liabilities, and stockholder's (or owner's) equity at a specific point in time.

==Prepaid Insurance== — unexpired portion of Insurance Expenses, listed as an asset in the Balance Sheet
==Insurance Expense== — the portion that expires in the current accounting period, listed as an expense in the income statement
##### Cost Principle and Conservatism
==Cost Principle== — each of the company's assets will be recorded at its original cost, even if the fair market value will increase
==Conservatism== — if the net realizable value of an inventory is less than the original recorded cost, the principle of conservatism directs that the accountant should report the lower amount as the asset's value on the balance sheet
##### Depreciation 
- used for assets whose life is not indefinite because some assets become obsolete
- it is the allocation of the cost of the asset to Depreciation Expense on the income statement over its useful life
- long-term assets are reported at their cost *minus* the amounts already sent to the income statement as

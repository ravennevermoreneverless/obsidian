***Indie Rock***
*Emo-Pop, Pop Punk*

after some careful observations, i can interpret this song as the guy getting over someone who has hurt them so immensely that he tries to cope with the pain by doing recreational drugs. in the first verse, he describes himself as walking like a skeleton one night, or perhaps every night, ever since the person broke him and has gotten rid of most of him, to the point of being only left with his skeleton. and yet, he's not completely left with nothing, he still has his bones, something left that the other person can't break any further; "*this white frame, it's all that i've got left. 'cause not even you could chew through my bones, i've got very strong bones*". onto the second verse where he uses metaphors to describe the person and how the guy can't get rid of them totally; "*you are the cops, you are my student loans*" and then the lyrics "*you are a head-shaped hole in a sheet rock wall, you are the pain i feel, you are the stud in the wall*" means that the guy has probably been hurting himself, figuratively or not, out of frustration, but ends up getting hurt more than intended because there was a stud in the wall which hit his head, causing even much pain. but he says that it's "*better than nothing at all*". the chorus repeats the same five lines about how he got so stoned that he slept on the front seat of his car, which he doesn't usually do. "*come on, baby, calm me down. you're the only one who knows how*" talks about how smoking weed is the only coping solution for him that works to forget his pain of heartbreak. the third verse hints that he has smoked weed before habitually, stopped, and now came back to it, because of the lyrics "*and i can tell that he's asking her yes or no questions, by the way she's shaking her head, from left to right, then up and down, then left to right again*" implying that he's seen the girl (confirmed) with some other guy and he's trying decipher their conversation from afar. he assumed that they hit it off, so the next line goes "*i'm gonna go get so stoned*" then the chorus repeats. i personally adore the way this song was sang; like some desperate loser guy who falls in love with girls out of her league, or clings to girls that give him some kind of attention. his voice is scratchy, yodell-y, and might crack any minute, but it fits so well with this genre of music, which i think is quite explosive, even festive in nature, yet its lyrics are packed with a type of pain that can only be reached when you really try and look into it. this song is made in a way that you could yell this out loud with complete disregard if you're ever gonna sound good; it's difficult to care about how you sound to others when you're singing from your heartâ€”and i think the vocalist certainly thinks that, too.

> Confused and alone
> Who was I kidding? I can't get past you
> You are the cops, you are my student loans
> You are a head-shaped hole
> In a sheet rock wall
> You are the pain I feel
> You are the stud in the wall
> Better than nothing at all

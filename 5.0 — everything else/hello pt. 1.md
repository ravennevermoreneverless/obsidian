ok ganito kasi,,,, last night nung lasing ka (and even sa message that u wrote) u kept saying how u've never felt this way even with ur ex-bf harryl, also how u didnt like it when he kisses u and such.. and it just got me thinking na i know i could never compare to him. because para sakin it's pointless to even attempt to do so kasi we're different and u've shared ur own experiences and love with him. i'm not belittling what u feel with me and what i feel about u basta i just cant bring myself to compare. naisip ko rin na kahit ganito, whatever we have, it's just strange na hindi ako nakakaramdam ng kahit anong selos even though i know u still harbor such strong capacities of love for him. kasi usually magsselos ako sa lahat ng bagay, lalo sa ganito kasi lagi ko iniisip na i could never bring myself to be in a relationship with someone who've had such a connection with their previous relationship(s) (which is really stupid btw). kaya ngayon, i don't feel any sense of possession towards u kahit ilan pa yang mahal mong iba because i don't treat u as some kind of possession or even hog all of ur love for myself. and then it got me thinking din na (kasi advanced ako mag-isip) even if u do end up with someone else, or go back to ur ex-bf, and we dont end up togetherâ€”i feel like i'd be totally okay with it, i don't know why. i just know what we feel for each other transcends more than just situationships and labels.

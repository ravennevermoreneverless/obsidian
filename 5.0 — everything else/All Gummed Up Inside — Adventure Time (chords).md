[Verse]
  G                       G7       Cm      Ab7
I can't keep pushing this down any deeper,
G              G7                Cm          Ab7
 Why do I keep trying if I can't keep her?

G             G7
 Every move I make,
                   Cm
Is just another mistake,
                       Ab7
I wonder what it would take,


[Pre-chorus]
                                Em             B7
Because it feels like there's a hole inside my body,
                Em             B7
Like there's a hole inside my heart.
               Em                  B7
It's like this feeling is gonna consume me,
           Em                       B7
If I keep waiting for this thing to start.


[Chorus]
                    G               Cm
Oh, I feel like I'm all gummed up inside,
              G               Cm
It's like I'm all gummed up inside,
              G                Cm    Ab7     G
It's like I'm all gummed up insi-i-i-i - i-i-ide

**Capo on 2nd Fret**

[Verse]

G
She's all layed up in bed with a broken heart
D/F#
While i'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar, and we don't know how
Em
How we got into this mad situation, only doing things out of frustration
C
Trying to make it work, but man these times are hard

G
She needs me now but I can’t seem to find the time
D/F#
I got a new job now on the unemployment line, and we don't know how
Em
How we got into this mess is it God's test?, Someone help us ‘cos we’re doing our best
C
Trying to make it work but man these times are hard


[Chorus]

                         Em
But we’re gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
C
Sit talking up all night,
G
Saying things we haven’t for a while
D/F#
A while yeah

        Em
You’re smiling but we’re close to tears,
C
Even after all these years
G                                           D
We just now got the feeling that we’re meeting

For the first time

G
Ooooooooooh
D/F#
Ooooooooooh
Em
Ooooooooooh
C
Ooooooooooh


[Verse]

G
She’s in line at the door with her head held high
D/F#
Well I just lost my job, I didn’t lose my pride, and we both know how
Em
How we’re gonna make it work when it hurts, when you pick up yourself up you get 
kicked to the dirt
C
Trying to make it work, but man these times are hard


[Chorus]

                        Em
But we’re gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
C
Sit talking up all night,
G
Doin’ things we haven’t for a while
D/F#
A while yeah

     Em
You’re smiling but we’re close to tears,
C
Even after all these years
G                                           D
We just now got the feeling that we’re meeting

For the first time

G
Ooooooooooh
D/F#
Ooooooooooh
Em
Ooooooooooh
C
Ooooooooooh


[Chorus]

Em
Yeah,  drinking old cheap bottles of wine
C
Sit talking up all night,
G                              D/F#
Saying things we haven’t for a while


Em
We’re smiling but we’re close to tears,
C
Even after all these years
G                                           D
We just now got the feeling that we’re meeting

For the first time

G
Ooooooooooh
Yeah, for the first time
D/F#
Ooooooooooh
Oh, for the first time
Em
Ooooooooooh
Yeah, for the first time
C
(We just now got the feeling that we’re meeting
For the first time)

G                                          D/F#
Oh these times are hard, end up making us crazy
Don’t give up on me baby 
Em                                        C
Oh these times are hard, end up making us crazy
C
Don’t give up on me baby

G                                          D/F#
Oh these times are hard, end up making us crazy
Don’t give up on me baby 
Em                                        C
Oh these times are hard, end up making us crazy
C
Don’t give up on me baby

![[My Voice (2017) â€” TAEYEON.jpg]]

the album started with ***make me love you***, a song about contemplation--desiring someone secretly, wanting to convey your emotions and connecting on a deeper level, to mold with someone heart and soul. then its jumps right into ***fine***, which is obviously a song about a melancholic break-up. with the words "take care" as the final farewell between two lovers. taeyeon did deliver the feeling of fresh heartbreak through her powerful yet somber voice. weirdly, the next song is ***cover up***, which is a song about having a crush on someone and finding it hard to hide your feelings for them. it's pop, upbeat, happy, a stark contrast to the previous song, it makes you wonder if they intended for it to be that way. ***feel so fine*** comes up with melodies talking about a hope for a new world, maybe that of parting with a loved one, moving forward and taking that step. ***i got love*** is probably one of my least liked songs in this album. it's like the background music for a really sexy red car advertisement or a perfume that lasts for weeks, probably named passionate lover or something, it feels out of place with the entirety of the album and it's not really that worthy of any titl***e, in i'm ok***, taeyeon tries a genre that resembles that of a country blues pop type of song. you can hear the resounding blues-like guitar strums in the background and its accompanying riffs, taeyeon's singing did bring their vision to fruition, that much i can say. ***time lapse*** is my favorite track in the whole album. aside from it being probably taeyeon's magnum opus, her best ballad song to date, and the best song she ever sang, it contains personal significance. this song was with me throughout my mourning phase when my korean ex-girlfriend chose her ex-boyfriend over me. all i can say is that it's what they call a "puppy love" and looking back to it, it was for the best that it happened that way, i wouldn't have loved this song as much if it wasn't for her breaking my heart. so thank you, chan mi. ***sweet love*** comes next and i'm starting to think this album is not entirely about break-ups. only the best songs are about failed relationships, which i'm not really complaining. this song is about being in love. i really like the chorus for this one as it showcases taeyeon's voice range and ability to hit high notes after high notes. i haven't seen her perform this live but i bet she could belt those notes like crackers and oats. ***when i was young*** deals with regrets and all those 'what if's. if i were you, would i have done differently? if you were me, would you understand? the desperation lingers in taeyeon's voice as the song keeps going. ***i blame on you*** is a fun ballad that screams desperation (once again) and longing for the person who's long separated from you. as usual, taeyeon's years of experience of singing ballad songs reflects on this particular song. i'd say this comes next to ***time lapse*** in terms of brokenheartedness and raw emotions through singing. of course, with the second stage of grief, we have ***lonely night***. wanting to forget everything, discard all the memories, live in despise and contempt for your former lover, it happens. ***11:11*** is one of the first songs i learned on that cheap red guitar my aunt bought me when i was in junior high. i spent the entire night until morning learning this song and i was super satisfied with how much i improved in such a short time, anyways, this song, heavy with acoustic guitars and piano melodies, is about wistful longing with a hint of acceptance. all of this will pass, you'd think, eventually. ***love in color***, it fades away. what once was filled with love is just a fading black-and-white photo from one of the boxes in the attic, hidden away, occasionally forgotten. ***fire*** has such beautiful vocal runs from taeyeon, it's really catchy too. it's one of my favorite tracks on here. i remember walking on the sidewalk at 5 in the morning listening to this while on my way to a burger king near my mom's office building. it was a long rough night and i really needed that, and a can of cold strong coffee. just a small anecdote, second to the last song in the deluxe version is ***eraser***, one of the songs in the album that i almost want to say i despise. it tarnishes the star-sprinkled songs like ***feel so fine*** and ***time lapse***. it's a shame this one's added. it's pop soul, nothing good ever comes out of pop soul (feel free to recommend me good pop soul music to maybe change my mind), ***curtain call*** has a reputation for "copying" or at least resembling bitter sweet symphony by the verve. i like that song so i was intrigued to hear that they sound similar... except when i listened to ***curtain call***, it doesn't even nearly similar to ***bitter sweet symphony***. i don't know how and where they got that idea. this song is the last song in the album and it feels like the ending of a romcom film. i can't really cite examples but it feels like a hand waving and the red curtains closing, confetti all around, claps ringing around the stadium. it's a farewell, in its most classical sense.

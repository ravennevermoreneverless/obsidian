**Tune down 1/2 step**


[Verse 1]

G
Lazy lover
       Dm
Find a place for me again
    C
You felt it once before
           G
I know you did
         F
I could see it

G
Whiskey Princess
         Dm
Drink me under, pull me in
    C
You had me at come over boy
  G
I need a friend
  F          D
I understand


[Chorus]

         Em
Backseat serenade
      C
Dizzy hurricane
   G                       D
Oh god, I'm sick of sleeping alone
                    Em
You're salty like a summer day
         C
Kiss the sweat away
        D
To your radio

         Em
Backseat serenade
       C
Little hand grenade

G
You take me over
            Dm
I throw you up against the wall
      C
We've seen it all before
               G
But this one's different
     F
It's deliberate

G
You send me reeling
        Dm
Calling out to you for more
    C                             G
The value of this moment lives in metaphor
      F                 D
Yeah, through it all

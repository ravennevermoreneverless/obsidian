[Verse 1]
C                     F                  Fm             C
Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world?
             F            Fm           C
That must be so confusing for a little girl
      F                            Fm        C
And I know you're going to need me here with you
         F                      Fm                          E7
But, I'm losing myself and I'm afraid you're gonna lose me, too


[Chorus]
E7                  D
This magic keeps me alive
                    Em     G7
But, it's making me crazy
               C
And, I need to save you
                    F
But, who's going to save me?
Fm                               C
Please forgive me for whatever I do
             E7
When I don't remember you


[Verse 2]
C                 F          Fm       C
Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away
         F               Fm      C
I can't remember what it made me say
      F               Fm      C
But I remember that I saw you frown
           F             Fm      E7
I swear it wasn't me, it was the crown


[Chorus]
E7                  D
This magic keeps me alive
                    Em     G7
But, it's making me crazy
               C
And, I need to save you
                    F
But, who's going to save me?
Fm                               C
Please forgive me for whatever I do
                  E7
When I don't remember you


[Bridge]
F                                Fm
Please forgive me for whatever I do
               C
When I don't remember you


[Outro]
C          F     Fm       C
Da da,  da da da da da,   da da 
   F     Fm       C
Da da da da da,   da da 
   F     Fm       C
Da da da da da,   da daaa

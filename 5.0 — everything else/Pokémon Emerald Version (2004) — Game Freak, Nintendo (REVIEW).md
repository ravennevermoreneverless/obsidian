this has been one of the games that gave me an escape at such a dark time of my life. it was there for me when no one else was and it gave me some time to stop me from going through with my self-destruct plan. i didn't use cheats before but now, i did, and homestly i feel no shame about it. i played this alongside my girlfriend, at a different phase of my life, and i just want to say i'm happy, i'm content, and i'm grateful for this game's existence.

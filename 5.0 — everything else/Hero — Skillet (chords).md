Verse 1:
I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away.
Losin' my faith today, I'm fallin' off the edge today.

I am just a man, not super human,
I'm not super human, someone save me from the hate.

Pre-chorus:
G#5
It's just another war, just another friendly door.
G#5                                                       G5
It's just another fear, Just another day in the world we live.

I need a Hero, to save me now.

Verse 2:
I gotta fight today, to live another day,
Speakin' my mind today, my voice will be heard today.

I've gotta make a stand, but I am just a man.
I'm not superhuman, my voice will be heard today.

The countdown begins to destroy yourself.

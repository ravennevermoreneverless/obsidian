[Verse 1]

                                       C
Father, father, tell me where have you been?
                             Em
Its been hell not having you here
                         C
I've been missing you so bad and you don't seem to care
     G             C  Em                C
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
     G             C  Em            C
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?
Em                                      G
Do you even miss us? Your bottle's your mistress
C
I need to know, I need to know


[Chorus]

Em                         C
Why are you walking away?
       G
Was it something I did? Did I make a mistake cause
    Em                        C
I'm trying to deal with the pain
  G
I don't understand this, is this how it is?
Em              C  G
I will try to understand


[Verse 2]

Its been hell not having you
G                                           C        Em
Last thing I heard, you were fed up, you're skipping town
        C
With no note telling where
     G             C  Em                C
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
     G             C  Em            C
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?
Em
I need to know, I need to know

Why are you walking away?
       G
Was it something I did? Did I make a mistake cause
    Em                        C
I'm trying to deal with the pain
  G
I don't understand this, is this how it is?
Em                     C
Why are you running away?
  G
I don't understand this, is this how it is?
Em                     C
Why are you running away?
G
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?


[Verse 3]

      G                                       C
Spent seven years wishing that you'd drop the line
      Em                                     C
But I carry the thought along with you in my mind
       G                       C
But is this what you call a family?
   Em                       C   G
Is this what you call a family?
   Em
Family!
Em                         C
Why are you walking away?
       G
Was it something I did? Did I make a mistake cause
    Em                        C
I'm trying to deal with the pain
  G
I don't understand this, is this how it is?

Why are you running away?

I don't understand this, is this how it is?

Why are you running away?
G
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family?

Is this what you call a family?
   C
Is this what you call a family?
   Em
Is this what you call a family?

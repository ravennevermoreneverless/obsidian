[Verse 1]  
  C                                       F           
Share with me the blankets that you're wrapped in,
              C                            F            
because it's cold outside (cold outside, it's cold outside).
 C                                  F                   
Share with me the secrets that you kept in
              Am                             G           
because it's cold inside (cold inside, it's cold inside).

[Pre-Chorus]
      F                                                 
And your slowly shaking finger tips
 C                                                     
show that you're scared like me.
Am                              G                           
So, let's pretend we're alone.
       F                                               
And I know you may be scared
       G                                               
and I know we're unprepared,
              C                                     
but I don't care.
                  
[Chorus]
                                    
Tell me, tell me,                                                      
        G/B                           F                       
what makes you think that you are invincible?                                                      
       Am                                  C             
I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure.
                          G/B                        F    
Please don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable.
                                                      
Impossible.

[Verse 2]
       C                  F                             
I was born to tell you I love you.
                    C                                  
Isn't that a song already? 
               F                                                           
I get a B in originality.
          C                   F                          
And it's true, I cant go on without you,
                          Am                             
your smile makes me see clearer.
                              G                        
If you could only see in the mirror what I see.
                                                      
[Pre-Chorus]
      F                                                 
And your slowly shaking finger tips
 C                                                     
show that you're scared like me.
Am                              G                           
So, let's pretend we're alone.
       F                                               
And I know you may be scared
       G                                               
and I know we're unprepared,
              C                                     
but I don't care.
                  
[Chorus]
                                    
Tell me, tell me,                                                      
        G/B                           F                       
what makes you think that you are invincible?                                                      
       Am                                  C             
I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure.
                          G/B                        F    
Please don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable.
                                                      
Impossible.

[Bridge]

Am   G/B     C                                               
Slow down, girl,
                   F                                   
you're not going anywhere.
      G                                                
Just wait around and see.
      Am  G/B   C                          F                        
Maybe I'm much more, you never know what lies ahead.
    G                Am         G/B     C                         
I promise I can be anyone, I can be anything.
        F                           G                    
Just because you were hurt doesn't mean you shouldn't bleed.
      Am   G/B     C                                             
I can be anyone, anything.
     F                       G                          
I promise I can be what you need.

[Chorus]
C                                                      
Tell me, tell me,
      G/B                             F                     
what makes you think that you are invincible?
       Am                                  C             
I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure.
                          G/B                        F    
Please don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable.
                                                        
Impossible.

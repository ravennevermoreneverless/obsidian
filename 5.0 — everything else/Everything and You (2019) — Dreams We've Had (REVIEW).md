![[Everything and You (2019) â€” Dreams We've Had.jpg]]

an album for falling in love and reminiscing a love lost to unfortunate circumstances or an ill-fated decision of the universe. yearning, crying, wistfully thinking.

***Aiyana (come down)*** opens up the album with some reverse synth effects, then jumps into somber piano keys, it comes to our attention that a relationship has long ended, and this is someone's musings late at night, by the window, looking at the stars. you said that it's too late now. but you still cross my mind, magical-sounding freckles of noises enters with an ongoing continuing note, going into a crescendo, onto the next song, a siren wails in tune, a few beats dropped in the same intervals. the feeling of being back in their arms, levitating, i was yours and you were mine, ***Darling***. still levitating, ***News From The War***, I hope this messages reaches you, I hope you're alright. the same beats from the last track resounds, this time in a different arrangement, up-and-down twinkles of sounds repeat throughout. a simple piano and a voice singing, the longing couldnt be put onto words and music, but this song, in all its simplicity, somehow can. you're the most beautiful being i've ever laid eyes on. ***Nothing Compares To You***. ***A Song I Wrote for You When We Were Falling in Love***, a brief track, weaker than the rest, kind of like a residual for the album, but sounding like water dropping, the longing can still be felt. like all those tiny moments you'd remember that might look insignificant yet it turned into core memories. flashes of everyday motions, a glimpse of today and yesterday, a weird winding noise comes by the end, just a note of warning. then, the wind blows, clinging onto someone and not clinging onto life itself. ***Benny Boy (A Beautiful Embrace)***, it's been a long time but i wonder how you're doing. i wonder if you can still save my life, like you always do. the sprinkles of music comes back like angels' harps, background synths, same type of notes probably, this album really likes sound sprinkles, this song is filled with it. it builds up for almost half the song then drops back down. i hope you think of me now, it might not be a good idea to kill yourself today, but ***You Can Always Kill Yourself Tomorrow***, the song ends with melancholic piano, like watching the clouds float by, blocking the star's twinkling. it builds up, everything you've done, everything you've dreamed and hope for, all the worn sweaters and crushed bags of peanuts during road trips, the lent books and chewed out pencil ends, the hellos and goodbyes-into a huge catharsis, it all breaks down. honest raw human emotions-not lyrical, not melodical-just emotions spilled like coffee on the top of a desk, onto an old parchment paper, you're ***Perfectly Out of Place***. a moment of silence, then suddenly, fireworks of amalgamated sounds, blended into one musically orgasmic explosion. a cry of desperation. it all hurts, but i love you the same, a message left on the receiver, you used to love me, and i'm replaying

everything you ever sent me. you used to love me, and i used to love you-i think i always will. ***It All Feels the Same***.

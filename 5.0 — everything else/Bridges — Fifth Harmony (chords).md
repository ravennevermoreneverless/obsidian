[Verse 1]
D                      G              Bm     G
Can't spend time in rewind, I'm sorry
D               G          Bm     G
Many times I remind myself
D                   G                Bm      G
We've come way too far in our stories, oh
D                             G             Bm
To build these walls and to blind ourselves
                 G
And for every action, there's a reaction

[Pre-Chorus]
        D                     G                     Bm
And I know the world can be cold, we can't let it divide us
                    G
There's something inside us, a power that grows
   D                                 G
There's something beautiful in the flaws in all we are
             Bm                      G
Something calling all of us and it says

[Chorus]
            D      G
We build bridges
               Bm      G
Oh, we build bridges
                D
No, we won't separate
                   G
We know love can conquer hate
              Bm      G
So we build bridges
               D     G
Bridges, not walls
               Bm    G
Bridges, not walls

[Verse 2]
D                        G
I believe in the beauty of love (hey)
Bm                        G
I believe that we really are one
D                            G
I believe every woman is a fighter
Bm                                  G
And I believe every man can stand beside her

[Pre-Chorus]
       D                      G                     Bm
And I know the world can be cold, we can't let it divide us
                     G
There's something inside us, a power that grows
   D                                 G
There's something beautiful in the flaws we all are
             Bm                     G
Something calling all of us and it says

[Chorus]
            D       G
We build bridges
                Bm      G
Oh, we build bridges
                 D
No, we won't separate
                    G
We know love can conquer hate
              Bm      G
So we build bridges
               D      G
Bridges, not walls
               Bm     G
Bridges, not walls

[Bridge]
D                 G
All I pray is we break our chains
         Bm                    G
Because love's worth fighting for

Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
D                 G
All I pray is we break our chains
         Bm                    G
Because love's worth fighting for

Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
D                  G
All I pray is we break our chains
          Bm                   G
Because love's worth fighting for

Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
D                  G
All I pray is we break our chains (all I pray is we break)
          Bm                   G
Because love's worth fighting for

Shed your light oh, oh, oh, oh
               D       G
So we build bridges (All I pray is we break our chains)
               Bm       G
So we build bridges (Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light oh)
               D        G
So we build bridges (All I pray is we break our chains)
              Bm             G
So we build bridges (Because love's worth fighting for, shed your light oh)

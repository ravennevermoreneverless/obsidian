this song's about sex—or at least resorting to sex, an act of intimacy, as a compensation for a deeper connection, which usually falls short of what a heart really desires—the song's about that, mostly, a friends-with-benefits type of relationship, that ended up as a one-sided love. the guy wants more than just sex; "*does he take care of you? or could i easily fill his shoes. but you say no*" but the girl doesn't reciprocate what he's feeling, she refused to be more than fuck buddies. the lyric "*she's got a boyfriend anyway*" repeats throughout the song which means there's no use in asking for an emotional connection or getting to know the girl more, because she's already in a relationship. this strikes me as a form of bitter irony, that they might as well have sex, if he can't get anything more than that. the song never arrives to a satisfactory chorus, as this signifies that their situationship never has a proper closure—it's only a bunch of buildups. mostly composed of sentimental downstrokes of the electric guitar, and then some repetitive riff around the end. then, as a stroke to his bruised ego, the guy reminds himself that he can get any girl he wants, i'd take them all out any day, and just have sex with them, they all got boyfriends anyway. the song ends with sounds resembling of sirens, how the sailors would be enamored with the mythical creature, sirens, in the sea, only to fall prey to them and meet their deaths—which closely represents how the guy feels about falling for a girl he can't have.

[Intro]
Em Am C D 

[Verse 1]
Em                             Am 
I'm at war with the world and they 
                      Em 
Try to pull me in the dark 
                       Am 
I struggle to find my faith 
                               Em 
As I'm slippin' from your arms 
                             Em 
It's getting harder to stay awake 
                          Am 
And my strength is fading fast 
                 G      D 
You breathe into me at last 
 
[Chorus]
     Em         C 
I'm awake! I'm alive! 
       G           D  
Now I know what I believe inside 
Em       C 
Now it's my time 
     G             D 
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life 
Em                  C 
Here (right here), right now (right now)!  
     G             D 
I'll stand my ground and never back down 
Em           C 
I know what I believe inside 
Am            Bm           Em 
I'm awake and I'm alive!

[Riff]
Em Am C D  

[Verse 2]
Em                              Am 
I'm at war with the word 'cause I 
                         Em 
Ain't never gonna sell my soul 
                          Am 
I've already made up my mind 
                                    Em 
No matter what I can't be bought or sold 

When my faith is getting weak 
                       Am 
And I feel like giving in 
                G       D 
You breathe into me again 

[Chorus]
     Em         C 
I'm awake! I'm alive! 
       G           D  
Now I know what I believe inside 
Em       C 
Now it's my time 
     G             D 
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life 
Em                  C 
Here (right here), right now (right now)!  
     G             D 
I'll stand my ground and never back down 
Em           C 
I know what I believe inside 
Am            Bm           Em 
I'm awake and I'm alive!

[Bridge]
Em                   Em 
Waking up Waking up, Waking up Waking up 
Em                   Em 
Waking up Waking up, Waking up Waking up 
        Am                           Em 
In the dark, I can feel you in my sleep 
                        C            D 
In your arms I feel you breathe into me 
                  Am                       C 
Forever hold this heart that I will give to you 
                        D          
Forever I will live for you!  

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
     Em         C 
I'm awake! I'm alive! 
       G           D  
Now I know what I believe inside 
Em       C 
Now it's my time 
     G             D 
I'll do what I want 'cause this is my life 
Em                  C 
Here (right here), right now (right now)!  
     G             D 
I'll stand my ground and never back down 
Em           C 
I know what I believe inside 
Am            Bm           Em 
I'm awake and I'm alive!

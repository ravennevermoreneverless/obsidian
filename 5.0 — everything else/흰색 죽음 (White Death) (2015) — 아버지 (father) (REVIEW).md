![[흰색 죽음 (White Death) (2015) — 아버지 (father).jpg|250x400]]

***감기(Cold)*** is the first track in the album and you immediately know what the album has in store for you: cold hard white-tiled kitchen floor and hospital beds, the ticking rhythmic metronome resounds in a repeating manner throughout the track. glimpses of recorded distorted voices pop up every now and then like whispers from the inside of your head, ***잃어버린(Lost)*** is deep, bass-y, and haunting due to the low-pitched humming and industrial-like scratches in the background. ***서리(Frost)*** sounds like sirens in the sky at late midnight. it reminds me of those noises i heard when i was 13 years old, i was the only one awake hearing this loud booming trumpet-like sound outside up in the sky. at times, the track may seem like it's too minimalistic and lacking in actual musical components as the music itself is subdued. but in unexpected bouts, those siren sounds rise up and fades away, again in a repeating manner. the repeating dreamy synths are a common reoccurence in this album, you can particularly notice it being used in ***죽은 잎(Dead Leaves)***. it might just be father2006's trademark. not much more can be said about this almost 10-minute track as the sounds just refresh and repeat, however, it's not about the variety in the song, but the atmosphere it gives off. ***눈의 꽃(Snow Flower)***: an old shack, lonely night, snowstorm, a rusty shovel, a weak fire inside an oil lamp, writing down the final letter to no one as the last of your minutes tick by. the silence interrupted by sudden yet gentle glitches, a drop of water, and dissonant presses of the piano keys. ***빨간(Red)*** feels like a continuation of the previois track, it has the same instances of piano key presses, mostly ranging higher pitches, which also glitches. ***화이트(White)*** would make you feel like your sound system is glitching or that your earphones or headphones are broken. every note is droned out, lasting more than 5 seconds each with several seconds of intervals in between. the snowflakes keep falling, creating large piles of snow, blocking the entrances and roads, nobody would know what happened because the snow was so white and the silence was so thick, no one. the final minutes of the track doesn't include long intervals between the droned notes. it slowly forms into a comprehensible sequence of notes, the snow might be getting shoveled out by the neighbors, after weeks of dark snowstorms and no daylights. they're starting to find out where the weird smell was coming from. the body was discovered. ***죽음(Death)*** was apparent--and inevitable. a soft low range piano melodies resound and a low-pitched distorted singing accompanies it, this is the end, it seems, nobody was shocked, no one.

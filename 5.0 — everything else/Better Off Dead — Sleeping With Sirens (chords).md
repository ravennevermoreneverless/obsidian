[Verse 1]

Bm                                           G
She says she wants to end it all when she's all alone in her room
         D
She cries
                     A
The way she feels inside is too much for her

Bm
When all you got is these four walls
      G                         D
It's not that hard to feel so small
                  A
Or even exist at all

G                                    A
How come no one heard her when she said


[Chorus]

                      Bm
Maybe I'm better off dead
                     G
If I was would it finally be enough
     D                               A
To shut out all those voices in my head?
                      Bm
Maybe I'm better off dead
             G
Better off dead!
          D
Did you hear a word
A               Bm
Hear a word I said?
         G              A
This is not where I belong

You're gonna miss me when I'm gone


[Post-chorus]

Bm      G
Gone, gone
D                      A
This is not where I belong
                               Bm
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone


[Verse 2]

Bm
She doesn't know she's beautiful
        G                           D
Because no one's ever told her so
                         A
And the demons that she has is all she knows

Bm                                     G                                 D
And maybe she can fall in love with someone in her life that she could trust
                      A
And tell her she's enough (Have someone tell her she's enough?)

G                                   A
How come no one heard her when she said


[Chorus]

                       Bm
Maybe I'm better off dead
                     G
If I was would it finally be enough
     D                               A
To shut out all those voices in my head?
                      Bm
Maybe I'm better off dead
        G
Better off dead!
         D
Did you hear a word
A                    Bm
Hear a word I said?
         G             A
This is not where I belong
                               Bm   G
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone


[Post-chorus]

D                      A
This is not where I belong
                               Bm
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone


[Bridge]

Bm
When all you got is these four walls
G
It's not hard to feel so small
Bm
When all you got is these four walls
A                                  Bm
It's not hard to feel so small
                           G
All she wanted was to be enough
                           D
All she wanted was to be enough
                       A
So what does it take?

Maybe it's not too late

G                               A
Yeah no one heard her when she said


[Chorus]

                      Bm
Maybe I'm better off dead
                     G
If I was would it finally be enough
    D                                A
To shut out all those voices in my head?
                      Bm
Maybe I'm better off dead
        G
Better off dead!
         D
Did you hear a word
A               Bm
Hear a word I said?
         G            A
This is not where I belong
                               Bm
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone


[Outro]

 G       D
Gone, gone
                       A
This is not where I belong
                               Bm
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
 G        D
Gone, gone
                      A
This is not where I belong
                               Bm
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

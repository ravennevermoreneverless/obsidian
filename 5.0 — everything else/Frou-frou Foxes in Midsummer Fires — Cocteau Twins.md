***Dream Pop, Neo-Psychedelia***
*Shoegaze, Ethereal Wave, Art Pop, Gothic Rock*

when i heard that the bandmates elizabeth fraser and robin guthrie gave birth to a baby during the production of its respective album, this song makes so much more sense; it's about a woman bearing a child in her womb. the majority of cocteau twins' songs has whimsical and often unintelligible lyrics, which appears quite random at times. but when you really listen and think about it, it kind of makes sense. "*their little hands, smooth all things*" indicates the purity of children and infants and how they touch souls, softening its rough edges. "*ad nauseam*", the next line, tells us that this certain purity is a seeming fact agreed upon and talked about by most of everyone in the world that it sometimes becomes repetitive and annoying as parents of couples often pressuring them to have a child of their own so they could acquire this "goodness". "*pulled rounder*" repeated by the end of each chorus describes how a pregnant woman's stomach or womb becomes rounder and rounder during her pregnancy in an act of 'pulling'; a word often used in replacement to 'molding' or 'shaping' as in the belly is shaping to be round because a baby's inside of it. "*pulled round, trousers, tighter*" in the interlude just tells us about how trousers become tighter on pregnant women because of the enlarged stomach or the weight gain during pregnancy. "*i'm losing the stars i enlisted to find you*" perhaps the woman has been wishing to bear a child that she figuratively asked the stars or the heavens above to grant her an offspring. but she's losing them now because she was already granted one, and she's doing her best to grow this child inside her. this entire song is driven by the melodical way of singing that it somehow doesn't necessarily need the accompaniment of instruments as it can already stand on its own. and yet, a somber haunting piano riff, a wall of noise created by distorted guitars, and a slight tweaking of the voice by adding echoes and second voices harmonizing and resounding in the distance—it makes the entire thing so dreamy and ethereal, you'd almost forget there were even drums in the first place.

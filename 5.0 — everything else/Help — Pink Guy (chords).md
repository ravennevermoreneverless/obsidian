**Capo on 7th Fret**

G C D C

[Verse 1]
G      C        D        C
I wake up in the mornings
G      C        D        C
Sinking halfway through the bottom
G      C        D        C
There's a loud distorted screaming in my soul
G      C        D        C
Everything is dark and empty
G      C        D        C
And I don't know how to fix it
G      C        D        C
So I curl up in a ball
G      C        D        C
And cry in the comfort of my home

[Bridge]
G      C        D        C
I don't know why
G      C        D        C
I feel like shit
G      C        D        C
I say I'm fine but I'm not fine

[Chorus]
G      C        D        C
I'm dying inside
G      C        D        C
And all I see are demons
G      C        D        C
I try to hide all my deepest feelings
G      C        D        C
I'm dying inside
G      C        D        C
And all I see are demons
G      C        D        C
I try to hide all my deepest feelings

[Verse 2]
G      C        D        C
I think there's something wrong with me
G      C        D        C
'Cause all I see is death
G      C        D        C
Everytime I go outside
G      C        D        C
I look like I've been doing meth
G      C        D        C
And I sleep for nineteen hours on a Thursday afternoon
G      C        D        C
And every now and then I cough up blood
G      C        D        C
And I don't know what to do

[Bridge]
G      C        D        C
I don't know why
G      C        D        C
I feel like shit
G      C        D        C
I will not see a therapist

[Spoken Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, if you wanna fucking kill yourself put your fucking hands up
(yeah!), raise your lights in the air everybody (yeah!)
(*coughing*)
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, help, help, help, help, help, help, HELP!

[Chorus]
G      C        D        C
I'm dying inside
G      C        D        C
And all I see are demons
G      C        D        C
I try to hide all my deepest feelings
G      C        D        C
I'm dying inside
G      C        D        C
And all I see are demons
G      C        D        C
I try to hide all my deepest feelings

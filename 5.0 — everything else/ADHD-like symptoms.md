- it's very very difficult for me to pay attention to details. it's more apparent when drawing: i get frustrated when my brain just refuses to focus on the details (that or i get ultra-focused on one particular spot).
- my focus fluctuates from having difficulties to focusing too much. in school, i tend to draw on my notebooks during lectures or solve the rubik's cube because i get bored easily and i believe i listen better that way. however, i can't tell you how many times i focused on a task too much that i lose track of time and forget to eat, drink water, take a bath, do chores, take my meds, etc etc (that is why i need an alarm). 
- i jump from one interest/hobby to another like a maniac. i get obsessive and addicted to certain hobbies/interests for months or weeks or even in a span of days, to the point of complete burnout. hypomania is mostly to blame here but it still happens even when medicated albeit mildly.
- i have trouble prioritizing things, and i dislike it because i think every single task is important. i will do tasks in order of "how i feel it should be" or i will do everything at once—there is no in between. i don't know how i survived school, to be honest.
- i am always ALWAYS doing something (this is why i can't say i get bored a lot because i'll always find something to do and focus on). anything small like: counting the number of pages all my notebooks and journals have or something big like: constructing an intricate system of micro-managing my life—then completely forget about it afterwards. this is apparent even when i was a kid, i am forever busy. i call them "little interests"

  

i'm having doubts getting checked for ADHD because:

1. i drink coffee everyday (only started when i went to junior high) so it might contribute to hyperactivity/inattentiveness
2. i am not very sure if common ADHD symptoms have occurred when i was a child because i am largely lacking in self-awareness back then plus i can't really remember a lot (and i can't really get much feedback from my parents because they weren't very involved in my childhood days)
3. i actually did fairly well in school (high performance and a lot of friends) except for the times when i get depressed or i don't go to school just to stay at home to play videogames and read 
4. i can say i have great organizational skills. mostly because bullet journaling used to be my addiction sometime during senior highschool, and it stuck all the way to adulthood. also, i desperately need a to-do list because i will forget a lot.
5. my friends tell me i'm a great listener so that must mean i pay attention well when people speak. 
6. i don't think i procrastinate a lot, or i try very very hard not to because i know i'll feel like shit if i do. i was praised for doing tasks immediately. 
7. i'm scared of asking my psychiatrist for a further evaluation because i'm afraid i'll get coldly turned down.

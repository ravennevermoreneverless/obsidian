[Verse 1]

C                                      C
Slow down, the world isn’t watching us break down
                        Am           F
It’s safe to say we are alone now, we’re alone now
      C                                  C
Not a whisper, the only noise is the receiver
                          Am
I’m counting the seconds until you break the silence
   F
So please just break the silence


[Chorus]

    Am
The whispers turn to shouting
    G
The shouting turns to tears
     C
Your tears turn into laughter
      F
And it takes away our fears

      C                                F
So you see, this world doesn’t matter to me
                    G           Am
I’ll give up all I had just to breathe
    C                        F
The same air as you till the day that I die
   G                         Am - G - F
I can’t take my eyes off of you

    C                                     C
I’m longing, for words to describe how I’m feeling


[Verse 2]

I’m feeling inspired
   Am
My world just flip turned upside down
    F
It turns around, say what’s that sound
       C C     C C      C C      C C
It’s my heart   beat, it’s  getting much louder
   C C     C C    C C
My heart   beat, is stronger than ever
    Am                    F
I’m feeling so alive, I’m feeling so alive


[Chorus]

   Am
My whispers turn to shouting
     G
The shouting turns to tears
     C
Your tears turn into laughter
       F
And it takes away our fears

      C                                F
So you see, this world doesn’t matter to me
                    G           Am
I’ll give up all I had just to breathe
    C                        F
The same air as you till the day that I die
   G                         Am
I can’t take my eyes off of you


[Verse 3]

                      F                     C
I’m finally waking up, a twist in my story
                   G                                   Am
It’s time I open up, and let your love right through me
                      F                    C
I’m finally waking up, a twist in my story
                    G                                   F
It’s time I open up, and let your love right through me
                  G
That’s what you get,
         Am               C        G     F
When you see your life in someone else’s eyes
                 G                  Am     G
That’s what you get, that’s what you get


[Outro/Chorus]

       C                                F
So you see, this world doesn’t matter to me
                     G           Am
I’ll give up all I have just to breathe
    C                        F
The same air as you till the day that I die
            G               C
I can’t take my eyes off of you
                              F
This world doesn’t matter to me
                    G          Am
I’ll give up all I had just to breathe
    C                          F
The same air as you till the day that I die
  G                         Am - G - F
I can’t take my eyes off of you

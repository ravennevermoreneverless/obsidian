[Verse 1]
Em                    A        Bm        D
Your hair's grown a little longer
Em                  A         Bm        D
Your arms look a little stronger
Em                A       Bm         D
Your eyes just as I remember (oh)
Em                    A        Bm
Your smile's just a little softer


[Pre-Chorus]
D            Em                A            Bm
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
           D               Em           A         Bm
Yeah, a second and it all came back, it all came back


[Chorus]
       G          A     Bm
'Cause after all these years
D                  G          A       Bm
I still feel everything when you are near
D                  G                       A       Bm
And it was just a quick "hello," and you had to go
                              D
And you probably will never know
                   G                 A     Bm
You're still the one I'm after all these years
   D
(Oh yeah)


[Verse 2]
Em                     A    Bm         D
Couldn't help but overhear you
Em                     A       Bm         D
Sounds like you're happy with her
Em                         A        Bm         D
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Em                           A      Bm
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you


[Pre-Chorus]
D            Em                A            Bm
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
           D            Em           A         Bm
Yeah, suddenly, it all came back, it all came back


[Chorus]
       G          A     Bm
'Cause after all these years
D                  G          A       Bm
I still feel everything when you are near
D                  G                       A       Bm
And it was just a quick "hello," and you had to go
                              D
And you probably will never know
                   G                 A     Bm
You're still the one I'm after all these years
     D
(Oh)
       G          A     Bm
'Cause after all these years
D                  G          A       Bm
I still feel everything when you are near
D                  G                       A       Bm
And it was just a quick "hello," and you had to go
                              D
And you probably will never know
                   G                 A     Bm         D
You're still the one I'm after all these years

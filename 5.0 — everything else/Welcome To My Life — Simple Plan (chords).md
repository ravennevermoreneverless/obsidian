**Capo on 6th Fret**


[Verse]

 G
Do you ever like breaking down?
       Em
Do you ever feel out of place?
     C
Like somehow you just don't belong,
    D
and no one understands you.
       G
Do you ever wanna run away?
       Em
Do you lock yourself in your room?
         C
With the radio on turned up so loud,
    D
and no one hears you screaming.


[Pre-Chorus]

C
No, you don't know what it's like
     Em
When nothing feels alright
    C                                    D
You don't know what it's like to be like me...


[Chorus]

      Em            C           G               D
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Em                 C                  G                  D
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Em             C                   G                 D
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
Am
No, you don't know what it's like

C               G
  Welcome to my life


[Verse]

 G
Do you wanna be somebody else?
        Em
Are you sick of being so left out?
        C
Are you desperate to find something more,
D
before your life is over?
        G
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
        Em
Are you sick of everyone around?
         C
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies,
      D
While deep inside you're bleeding


[Pre-Chorus]

C
No, you don't know what it's like
     Em
When nothing feels alright
    C                                    D
You don't know what it's like to be like me...


[Chorus]

      Em            C           G               D
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Em                 C                  G                  D
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Em             C                   G                 D
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
Am
No, you don't know what it's like

C              G
 Welcome to my life...


[Bridge]

C
No one ever lies straight to your face
    Em
And no one ever stabs you in the back
      C
You might think I'm happy
        G            D
But I'm not gonna be okay
      C
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
    Em
You never had to work, it was always there
    C                                    D
You don't know what it's like, what it's like...


[Chorus]

      Em            C           G               D
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Em                 C                  G                  D
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Em             C                   G                 D
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
Am                                           C
No, you don't know what it's like, what it's like

      Em            C           G               D
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
      Em                 C                  G                  D
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around
      Em             C                   G                 D
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
Am
No, you don't know what it's like


[Outro]

C              G    Em
 Welcome to my life
               C    D
 Welcome to my life
               G
 Welcome to my life...

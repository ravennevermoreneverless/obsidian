[Intro]
G C Em D C D G

[Verse 1]
      G
Your hand fits in mine
           G
Like it's made just for me
     C
But bear this in mind
      C
It was meant to be
        Em
And I'm joining up the dots
           D
With the freckles on your cheeks
       C          D        G
And it all makes sense to me
    G
I know you've never loved
      G
The crinkles by your eyes
           C
When you smile,
You've never loved
       C
Your stomach or your thighs
     Em
The dimples in your back
        D
At the bottom of your spine
          C         D      G
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus]
Am                          C
 I won't let these little things
      Em             D
 Slip out of my mouth
          Am
 But if I do
       C
 It's you
          Em 
 Oh it's you
             D
 They add up to 
         C
 I'm in love with you
                        G
 And all these little things

[Verse 2]
G
You canâ€™t go to bed
    G
Without a cup of tea
     C
And maybe that's the reason
           C
That you talk in your sleep
     Em
And all those conversations
         D
Are the secrets that I keep
           C        D        G
Though it makes no sense to me
   G
I know you've never loved 
      G
The sound of your voice on 
   C                    
Tape, you never want to 
 C
Know how much you weigh  
Em
You still have to squeeze
   D
Into your jeans
     C         D       G
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus]
Am                          C
 I won't let these little things
       Em        D
 Slip out of my mouth
              Am
 But if it's true
       C
 It's you
          Em 
 Oh it's you
              D
 They add up to 
         C
 I'm in love with you
 And all these little things

[Bridge]
Am             C
 You'll never love yourself
         Em              D
 Half as much as I love you
Am              C                   G
 You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
        D
 But I want you to
Am             C
 If I let you kno-o-o-w
      G        D
 I'm here for you
Am             C                 Em      D
 Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you. Oh..
Am                               C
 And I've just let these little things
      Em         D
 Slip out of my mouth
              Am
 'cause it's you
          C
 Oh it's you
      Em
 It's you
             D
 They add up to
             C
 And I'm in love with you
 And all these little things

[Chorus]
Am                          C
 I won't let these little things
      Em          D
 Slip out of my mouth
              Am
 But if it's true
       C
 It's you
      Em
 it's you
             D
 They add up to 
         C
 I'm in love with you
                       G
 And all your little things.

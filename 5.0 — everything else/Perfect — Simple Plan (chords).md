[Verse 1]

D
Hey dad look at me
G
Think back and talk to me
D                          G
Did I grow up according to plan?
D                                      G
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
D                                     G
But it hurts when you disapprove all along
Em
And now I try hard to make it
G                       D
I just want to make you proud
D                                  Em
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
                            G
I can't pretend that I'm alright
A
And you can't change me


[Chorus]

        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect


[Verse 2]

D
I try not to think
G
About the pain I feel inside
D                               G
Did you know you used to be my hero?
D                              G
All the days you spent with me now seem so far away
D                                  G
And it feels like you don't care anymore
Em
And now I try hard to make it
G                        D
I just want to make you proud
D                                  Em
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
                        G
I can't stand another fight
A
And nothing's alright


[Chorus]

        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect


[Bridge]

G                            A               D
Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
G                        A       D
Nothing's gonna make this right again
Bm
Please don't turn your back
   A
I can't believe it's hard
G
Just to talk to you

But you don't understand


[Chorus]

        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect

        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect

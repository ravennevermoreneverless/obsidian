this game was meant for you to end up with someone from the game team. the choosing-to-be-alone ending isn't as powerful as that of ending up romantically with a person. i think it very much highlights the warmth of human connection, despite the vastness and coldness of eternal space. it's not terrible, immortality, but the choices we make, the endings we do end up with in this lifetime, solidifies this one path that we chose. what matters is the now, be there for it.

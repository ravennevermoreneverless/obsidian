The *Reversed Six of Cups* at the top signifies my current predicament. I’m disappointed in myself for giving up, for failing to hold a job, for running away. I shouldn't be too hard on myself. The card below it is the *Six of Wands,* which talks about the connection. It says I’d have public recognition for my efforts. I’m now confident and self-assured because of it. It reminds me of how I showed her my artworks about her. Perhaps this card is telling me that my efforts were appreciated, and admired even. The card below it is the *King of Swords*, which tells us that I stand firm in my truth and express myself in deep conviction. How I came upfront with her and told her if we’re gonna be friends, I’d like to be transparent about our past relationship. Was it wise? It may be. Perhaps it’s a gentle push for her to think about us and her feelings, for once. On the left side, there’s the *Six of Pentacles*, which is me. I’m currently kind, compassionate, and positive. I’m not sure if that's true but I do feel a little lighter now, in contrast to my past 2 weeks. Just below this card is the *Five of Wands* in Reverse, which supports the previous card. There must be an internal conflict in me. Like parts of me are fighting for something. If I can listen well, given the context, it's about how I didn't really want to move on from her, but I did, and somehow I’d like to go back and relive my attachment. Unfortunately, that can't ever happen again. On to the right side, the *Eight of Pentacles*, which symbolizes CJ. Someone who’s patient, diligent, hardworking, studious. Perhaps this is a time when she's focusing more on her duties, perhaps her job, and she’s investing a lot of time and effort to it. I wouldn't know for sure, just a feeling. The Reversed *Ace of Wands* supports this card. It tells us she has the energy and passion to move things forward but she’s lacking direction. She has absolutely no idea what she wants to do now. Maybe after I showed her the artworks, she felt lost. I don't blame her, it was a bit sudden. Anyways, regardless of what she makes of it, I didn't really intend to get a reaction out of her. I just wanted to be transparent, because I want us to be close friends.

The *King of Swords* represents authority, law, and being calm and collected. Paired that with *The Hierophant*, it means it might be a good decision to stick to tradition and conventional means. The *Seven of Cups* means daydreaming and wishful thinking. Paired that with The *Four of Swords*, it means the previous card is finally laid to rest and to be engulfed in tranquility. It probably means my days of contemplation and imagination filled with limerence is done. The *Five of Wands* in reverse signifies avoiding conflicts or finally worked through certain troubles. With The *Two of Swords* in reverse as a pair, which means making a choice from opposing factions, this could mean I am contemplating with making decisions. With what decisions, I've yet to know.  The *Page of Swords* stands for curiosity and communication of ideas or being passionate about turning an idea to life. This is paired with The *Seven of Swords* in reverse, which means coming clean and releasing a truth to remove the guilt. All I can think of is me telling my former internet friends the reason I cut them off. A part of them knows but the air would be clean if I came clean. But I don't think I'm ready to make that decision yet. I pulled the *Death* card, which means it's an end of a phase, and I'm going through scary changes and transitions. It is, amazingly, paired with The *Five of Swords* in reverse, which means a desire for reconciliation, desire for these feelings to be over so that I can forgive and forget. That's crazy.

==January 23, 2022 - Dream Interpretation==
***Past Event (What is the background or context for this dream?  What recently happened that made this dream come up?):*** The *Knight of Swords* tells me how I've made a pretty decisive decision without thinking or considering any upcoming challenges ahead. One abrupt decision I can remember that I did before these dreams came was when I decided to bring back my friend group together.
***Dream Theme (What is the dream focusing on? Is it a warning? Is it encouragement?):*** The *Nine of Cups* is the ultimate card for self-satisfaction and fulfillment. It means the thing that I most desire for or my most perfect dream is bound to happen after a series of ups and downs and sacrifices.
***Waking Life Block (What prevents you from addressing the dream's message in your waking life?):*** The *Seven of Swords* upright is a card for betrayal and deception. It could also mean running away from problems and hoping it'll solve itself over time. This could be me or another person in my life who's running away or lying about something. Perhaps there isn't enough clarity in a situation which prevents me from interpreting these dream's messages correctly; may it be because of me or someone else.
***Message (What is the dream trying to tell you? What advice is being offered?):*** The *Page of Swords* upright signifies this: *"Bright and alert, the Page of Swords is someone who never seems to run out of ideas. She is curious, always asking questions, and gifted with a sharp tongue and quick wit to match. Her aptitude for language also makes her an incredible communicator, and with her love of ideas, you may find her always engaged in some passionate debate."* which could mean that it's about me. Once I execute my ideas in an authentic raw manner, people would like me better—which might mean my art journey that leads to self-satisfaction and contentment. Another meaning for this is when I take my dream literally (about love and relationships). It signifies someone wary of emotional intimacy and avoids confrontations altogether. It can also mean one person feels their emotional needs are not being met. This could be far from the interpretation considering I'm not in a relationship in my waking life. But if I were to connect this to the precious cards, this is a huge significant deal.
***Lesson (What can you learn from this dream? What can you do better?  What can you do to address this dream in waking life?):*** The *King of Pentacles* reminds me to stay in control of my energy and my resources in pursuit of a larger goal. Because this card can indicate that the person I've been waiting for can come along and will love me for who I am.

==February 5, 2022 - For Laurente==
***Is this about my past relationship with my former that I recently unpacked?*** - The *Queen of Swords* represents a wiser older feminine intellect even though it's the most masculine of all the queens. She relies more on practicalities rather than on emotions which may come off as being stern and emotionless. Truth is very important to the *Queen of Swords*, she feels no need to soften her comments and therefore has the need to say what must be said, even if it hurts. Looking at the imagery, the Queen is using a cloth to pacify the large bird. It could mean that the Queen is silencing a part of herself and/or in a way, self-sabotaging. This could not necessarily be about your past relationship but there may be some parts of yourself that you're still keeping from the outside world because you're still afraid of what might people think of you.
***What should I do about this?*** - The *Five of Cups* symbolizes disappointment and things not going the way you want them to. Instead of turning towards a more positive perspective, it seems that you are still dwelling in the past filled with self-pity and regret. You have issues of letting go of something heavy from your past and as a way of self-sabotaging, you refuse to let this go because you're still blaming yourself with something. What you're going to do about it is learn to identify which part of yourself are you having trouble letting go of. Is it guilt? Is it regret? Think about it for a while, write it down if possible. The only way to move forward is to admit to yourself what it is that's keeping you from doing so.
***What do I need to do to ensure I will end up with a healthy transition and the right path?*** - "*The King of Swords reversed is challenging you to resist reverting to fixed assumptions about yourself, or your possibilities, without questioning them. Reach out and open yourself to perspectives which may not be aligned with your comfort zone. Walk in another’s shoes for a day. Look at challenging issues with another’s perspective instead of dismissing them outright. Instead of avoiding what you don't understand, dive in and learn more. Engage in reasoned, dispassionate debate. Arm yourself with knowledge."* Maybe what this means is you need time for yourself that calls for more self-reflection. No one knows themselves in a concrete manner because we are all ever changing beings. You don't need to have a fixed state or a fixed personality; listen to what your mind and heart has to say, don't dismiss them.  Maybe once you've heard, listened and absorbed what your true self has to say, only then you can transition into a newer and better version of yourself.

==November 3, 2021==
**Why is today significant?** - The *Nine of Wands* shows the final challenge I have to conquer after this long battle I'm facing, this is the last test of strength and courage before the end. The *Ten of Wands* represents a huge burden that I've been carrying for a while now but I'm now reaching my destination and I'm close to finding my release. The *Hanged Man* is all about release, letting go and surrendering. It shows an image of a man floating aimlessly on a body of water. He's surrendering control of things, he's letting the water take him to where he needs to be. The *Temperance* means balance and staying true to your meaning. I'm letting the water take me but I still have to stay grounded to what my higher purpose is. It is an ascension of oneself towards the balance of feminine and masculine traits. The *Devil* card can mean a lot of things; addiction, emptiness, obsession, and materialism—but it could also mean just enjoying life's earthly pleasures. In the card's imagery, the devil himself is missing, what it shows are just the silhouettes of trees and a path to somewhere. Seeing the card as it is, in the forest with the leaves on the ground and rows of trees, it must mean it's enjoying what the world has to offer and indulging in it (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and in relation to The Hanged Man, I'll just have to see where it'll take me.

==November 4, 2021==
- **Daily check-in**: *today's feelings, health and thoughts* - The S*even of Swords* shows that today I'm feeling like I'm proud of myself for getting away from something. It must be an obstacle or a problem I sneakily avoided; subconsciously or not. The *Seven of Pentacles* means I've been working hard on something for a while now and I will harvest the fruit of my labor but I need to be careful not to overexert myself and with regards to my health. I'm feeling the consequences of focusing too much on work/hobbies and not really sleeping enough and taking time to rest. My creativity and intellect is making me think like a king today, as indicated by the *King of Wands*. Sometimes I would think like people are just lizards around me, which I would have to keep in check because that's not a good comparison at all, but often times I think no one understands me at all and reaches the same level of thinking. The king sits at the throne, proud and confident, but he is alone.

==November 8, 2021==
***Which way should I go?*** - The first card that appeared was the *Knight of Wands* which talks about passion, impulsiveness and inspired action. Maybe something will give me a kick/push to make a choice and initiate action. It seems like I'll feel it when I'm ready. The second to appear is the *Queen of Swords* which shows independence, unbiased judgment, clear boundaries and direct communication. I feel like some kind of "talk" will happen and I'll see it with fresh eyes and a clearer perspective, without judgment. I will think and talk for myself and how I feel. The *Knight of Cups* gives me a feeling of silent wonder and appreciation for the beauty of everything. It feels like a sense of clarity and understanding for something that cannot be put into words and he's just standing there. The lands are barren and there's nothing in sight, but the power of emotion and endless imagination will create something new and beautiful somehow. Quoted from a website: "*When faced with an actual decision, the Knight of Cups is going to listen to his heart, regardless of whether this is actually a logical choice or not. He can also manifest as an event or a person in your life, or a part of your own self. He appears as a messenger – and with him, he carries an invitation or an arrival of something or someone which is going to have a certain emotional benefit for you. As a knight, he is also charged with taking the gifts of his suit, and bringing it outward into the world. He therefore can also represent the undertaking of some project with significant emotional or creative value for you."* The *Seven of Wands* symbolizes challenge or perseverance but the more I see the image, it seems to me that there is contemplation of the situation. The man is staring at the strange crow with wonder. However, in a love reading, it means holding your ground, setting boundaries and fighting for the what I feel is the right thing to do. The *King of Cups* sits at his throne with authority yet boldly compassionate. He commands and yet he understands. The king is in control and he listens. The *Three of Cups* in reverse is the last thing to appear. It means, if ever there is an event or celebration to happen, it will not go as planned because I won't have time to socialize or have fun with my social circle. This may seem fitting if we're going to consider my upcoming birthday as well as all the upcoming deadlines and events during the week. But I wonder what the significance of this card is. Maybe this actually nails the date in the head, some time at the third week of November.

- ***What will guide me*** - it is said that the *Nine of Swords* is all about fear, anxiety, negativity, breaking point, despair, nightmares and isolation. This is the same woman from the previous card (*Eight of Swords*) and she's finally released from the nightmare, but what's left are the nightmares and sufferings of what she's experienced. I'm currently experiencing a breaking point, but I think this will be the key to guiding me to what I truly want and deserve from what's been happening. Waking up from a nightmare can be fearful and traumatizing, but once you've seen what could and couldn't happen, eventually you will find a light at the further end of the tunnel, albeit a little far but it's there.
- ***What will I experience*** - The *Chariot* is all about overcoming challenges and gaining victory from any situation. This card reminds me to maintain focus, confidence and determination through this process that I've been going through. I should pursue a plan with a structured and ordered approach. Maybe this tells me that despite everything, I should still keep a strong front and maintain what I've been doing for the past few months.
- ***What must I learn*** - The *Queen of Pentacles* in reverse means being self-absorbed, selfish and envious of those around me. I lose the ability to take care of myself and my surroundings. This means I have to ground myself again because I've been feeling very distracted and out of focus from my goals and what matters most, and it's true. I haven't been working on my art portfolio for a while now because I've been dealing with a lot of emotional, mental and physical stress. This card also suggests that those that I care for are now ready to become accountable and responsible for their own lives. It means I must learn to let go and give them their independence.

==November 15, 2021==
 ***What will guide me*** - A quote I got from a page about the *Five of Wands*: *"The five men may signify problems in a group of people who are not patient enough to listen to what anyone else is saying. They only want to be heard, and since none of the others will listen, they all argue at once."* This might be a clash of egos or aggression/conflict in a group of people I'm around with. This will guide me into having a more peace of mind, controlling my temper and being patient despite differences. This might also mean that it will encourage that me accept the competition as a way for me to improve myself without feeling any malice towards them.

***What will I experience*** - The *Eight of Pentacles* talks about skill, craftmanship, expertise, mastery, commitment and dedication. If you're going to look at the card image, it shows a girl surrounded by these flowery pentacles which symbolizes being fully-immersed and being committed in delivering the best version of her work, may it be professionally or personally. This indicates a time that I have to work hard and focus entirely on my tasks.

***What must I learn*** - the *Magician* card in reverse is a master of illusion. This might mean that there is someone in my circle who lures me in by the showmanship of the arts, but behind there may be an intention to manipulate for selfish gain. It could also mean that I need to do a bit of changes because I seem to be out of touch with some things right now (which is myself). I can tell something is wrong with me at the moment but I couldn't figure out what, I might find out today.

***What does the spirits say about your relationships in school?*** - The *Three of Wands* in reverse means a lack of planning for future or changes in the future. It might also mean that there are some obstacles in achieving the set goals that I have in mind but that doesn't mean everything I've done so far is for nothing. The *Knight of Cups* signifies charming attributes, nobility, artistic capabilities and the symbol of purity, light and spirituality. He is in touch with his emotions and intuitions which will appear attractive to people regardless of gender. It can be observed that even though he's a knight, he's not charging forward with a horse. Instead, his entire demeanor is steady, calm and at peace with himself.  The *Nine of Swords* in reverse symbolizes anxiety and stress of past trauma or unresolved issues. This might mean that challenges in school, the people pleasing tendencies, fearing what other people will think of me, lack of authenticity, are bubbling up in the surface if I'm not careful enough.

==November 19, 2021==
***What was today's overall theme?*** - The *Page of Pentacles* generally refers to the kind of energy that I need to complete all the work tasks no matter how boring they seem to be. It may point to determination, focus and the ability to stick to a task until it's done.  The *Eight of Pentacles* card means that I'm fully-immersed, dedicated and committed to the task that's assigned to me and to my passions. The *Magician* card in reverse might mean that there's someone out there who's tricking me into believing I have their best interest at hand even though the opposite is true. The *Star* card signifies rejuvenation of hope and strength and healing from all past wounds. In the imagery, we can see how the star's energy are being transferred upon the woman who's being lifted at the same time. It's a time to rejoice for I have gone far from where I started. The *Three of Pentacles* upright is a sign that I enjoy working together as a team in achieving an initial success of a project. Here's a direct excerpt from the page: *"The three pentacles reveals a successful beginning towards achieving your goals, it is a sign of encouragement that you should press on with the same effort without giving up"* which is absolutely magnificently true today. My group and I in the Filipino subject collaborated well in finishing our tasks and they were very responsive and welcoming with ideas and work even when it's an asynchronous type of day today. I think our LF is pretty impressed by our diligence and persistence for working. The *Two of Cups* upright in a work setting might mean that people are starting to appreciate me more, this involves mutual respect and comfortability. This is also a sign that people are willing to work well and collaborate with me.

==December 31, 2021 New Year Reading==
***Last year's major lesson:*** *Two of Pentacles* in reverse represent being disorganized and messy, trying to juggle much too many things in my life. I should've avoided committing to a lot of things that I know overwhelms me.

***Last year's biggest achievement:*** *Temperance* in reverse means a lack of balance. When I took a certain path, it backfired on me (joining the Student Council). It says that all things are good in moderation and I took the good decision of backing out and prioritizing my mental health.

***What I let go of last year***: Knight of Wands in reverse can translate to a loss of power, things that are totally out of my control. This might signify that I let go of control and let things go the way they should, it wouldn't necessarily mean that I'm lost.

***What to expect this year:*** *Page of Swords* represent an abundance of energy. Being an energetic youth that's filled with wit and curiosity, never running out of ideas. This card may indicate that I am very eager to execute an idea that I've been having and being passionate about art projects.

***This year's biggest challenge:*** The High Priestess signifies inner knowledge, listening to intuition instead of intellect and conscious mind. I might have difficulties in this area regarding my inner life and spirituality. *Seven of Cups* also appeared as a big challenge. This signifies how much of a dreamer I am and at some point, I have to stop fantasizing and face the reality I live in. If it is a love reading, it means I have to be cautious about romantic decisions. *"You will need to separate what is real and what is not so that you can make better decisions."*

***This year's theme:*** "*Two of Wands*" The main theme of 2022 is planning, moving forward, discovery and stepping outside my comfort zone. This is the beginning of new experiences and new worlds, I'm set out to achieve a goal and I'm turning my ideas to a realistic plan.

***Advice for this year:*** *"Ace of Wands*" *"You are about to experience a moment of breakthrough. You will see the world in a new point of view, as a place filled with nothing but new possibilities. It is, therefore, the best time to work on your goals — as the aces all give green lights and are signals of making opportunities and new beginnings."*

***The transition from last year to this year:*** *"The Empress"* A divine connection with the mystical realm. I am entering this coming year with nothing but abundance and blessings. It's showing how deeply in tune I am to creativity, femininity and expression. It's calling me to connect with beauty and bring happiness to my life. I believe I am going to be successful and well taken care of. Spirits guide me.

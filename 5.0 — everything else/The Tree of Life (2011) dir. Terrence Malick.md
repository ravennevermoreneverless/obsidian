one does not simply give a review for this film without being subjective. 

it's not about what happened in the movie; working out the plot or the order of the scenes, it's about how it makes you feel. the whole film looks like fragmented pieces of memories recalled at your deathbed, being compared to the grand scheme of things—making us realize how insignificant and meaningless our lives are. the lack of dialogue doesn't make it bad, you can make a good film with only just a few words and i think terrence malick nailed it on this one. the shots of nature felt like it came straight off of a nat-geo series, but it's beautifully done. 

i agree to what most people say; you shouldn't ask and look for the meaning behind the movie because it's like you're asking for the meaning of life itself. it's open for interpretation, just like how you give your own meaning to your life. and i think that's the beauty of this film.

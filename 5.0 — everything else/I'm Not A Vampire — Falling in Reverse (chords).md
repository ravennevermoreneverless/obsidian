[Verse]
Dm
Well I'm not a vampire
                Gm  
But I feel like one
            Bb
Sometimes I sleep all day
                   A        A7
Because I hate the sunlight
Dm
My hands are always shaking

Body's always aching
        Gm
And the dark is when I feed
           Bb                                  A   A7
Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me

[Bridge]
(In this part, Bb is a bar on the first fret, and you keep barring and go up the fretboard)  
    Bb               C          Dm    E   F 
And whiskey seems to be my holy water
            (pinch strings A D &G ONLY^^^^)                               
Bb             C                   A         A7
Mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters

[Chorus]
Dm
I'm insane
            Gm
Well, I can feel it in my bones
Bb
Coursing through my veins
A                    A7
When did I become so cold?
Dm
For goodness sake
      Gm
Where is my self-control?
   Bb
If home is where my heart is
        A         A7
Then my heart has lost all hope

[Verse]
     Dm                               Gm
Well I'm not a zombie but I feel like one
      Bb                     A        A7
Today self induced comatose, chemical daze
   Dm
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision
       Gm
And my stomach has had enough
  Bb
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby
           A               A7
'Cause I'm always throwing up

[Bridge]
Bb             C             Dm     F
Hi, My name is Ronnie I'm an addict # (Hi, Ronnie!)
Bb                C               A        A7
Daddy should have never raised me on Black Sabbath!

[Chorus]
Dm
I'm insane
            Gm
Well, I can feel it in my bones
Bb
Coursing through my veins
A                    A7
When did I become so cold?
Dm
For goodness sake
      Gm
Where is my self-control?
   Bb
If home is where my heart is
        A         A7
Then my heart has lost all hope

[insane solo]
If you're inept like me, just play the same chord progression from the verse a few times. :3

[Buildup]
Dm                   Bb
God bless all of you now
Dm                           C  
'Cause I'm going straight to Hell
Dm                           Bb
And I'm taking you down with me
Dm                   A A7
'Cause you know damn well

[Chorus]
Dm
I'm insane
            Gm
Well, I can feel it in my bones
Bb
Coursing through my veins
A                    A7
When did I become so cold?

[Chorus]
Dm
I'm insane
            Gm
Well, I can feel it in my bones
Bb
Coursing through my veins
A                    A7
When did I become so cold?
Dm
For goodness sake
      Gm
Where is my self-control?
   Bb
If home is where my heart is
        A         A7
Then my heart has lost all hope

    Gm
All hope
    Bb      A   A7
All hooooooooooooope

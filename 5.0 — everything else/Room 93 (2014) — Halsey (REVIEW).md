![[Room 93 (2014) — Halsey.jpg]]

it's been years since I last listened to this EP in full. i was in my junior year of high school, at the height of my dating life yet. i was young, a tad bit dumb, and naïve, this was one of the EPs in my older brother's laptop that i copied to my drive. i thought it was the best thing ever. 7 years later, i'm an entirely different person, sad to say, this doesn't hold up as much as i want it to. regardless, ***Is There Somewhere*** still remains as one of the most significant songs in my life. it perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being young, of falling in love, and keeping things as a secret in all its subtleties and hidden touches. the buildup is still euphoric and goosebumps-inducing. i like listening to it and reminscing a brief moment of my life in hotel rooms and knee-high socks and sneaking out of my parent's house just to go see my then girlfriend. ***Ghost*** comes as a runner-up for my favorite tracks in this EP. maybe it's that way because it comes just right after the first track, so the thrill still haven't worn off. but on its own, i think ***Ghost*** still has its charm, as well as the last track, the stripped version of ***Trouble***. back then, i used to imagine myself learning this on the piano and singing at the same time. though i didn't have a piano keyboard because we were poor. i'm not even gonna talk about the other two songs in this EP because they're not that great imo.

[Verse]

Cadd9           C
Am I better off dead
Am                G
Am I better off a quitter
Cadd9                   C
They say I'm better off now
Am                   G
Than I ever was with her
F                     Am             G
As they take me to my local down the street
            Em      F            Am             G
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet
Cadd9          C           Am                G
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
Cadd9             C      Am            G
But after one too many I know that I'm never
F             Am                      G
Only they can see where this is gonna end
             Em        F            Am              G
But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense


[Chorus]
C
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
G
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
Am
I'm swearing if I go there now
F
I can change your mind, turn it all around
C
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
G
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
Am
Dial her number and confess to her
F
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

Cadd9    C     Am     G


[Verse 2]

Cadd9        C            Am                   G
So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
Cadd9                 C                Am          G
I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses
F                       Am              G
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
Em                       F
If she sees how much I'm hurting
       Am               G
She'll take me back for sure


[Chorus]

C
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
G
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
Am
I'm swearing if I go there now
F
I can change your mind, turn it all around
C
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
G
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
Am
Dial her number and confess to her
F
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

C

G
She said nothing
Am                                    F
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
         C
Oh I got nothing

Nothing

G
I got nothing

Nothing

Am                                    F
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing


[Bridge]

Em    F

C
Oh sometimes love is intoxicating

Em    F

C
Oh you're coming down your hands are shaking

Em    F

C
When you realise there's no one waiting

Em    F

C

Cadd9           C
Am I better off dead
Am                G
Am I better off a quitter
Cadd9                   C
They say I'm better off now
Am                   G
Than I ever was with her


[Chorus] 

C
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down

And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words

G
She said nothing
Am                                    F
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
         C
Oh I got nothing

Nothing

G
I got nothing

Nothing

Am                                    F
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

C     G      Am      F

Capo on 1

[Intro]
 C Am x2

[Verse 1]
C                                     
  There's so many things that I could say
Am
But I'm sure it would come out all wrong
C                                
  You got something that I can't explain,
Am
Still try and try and let you know

[Verse 2]
           C
That first summer we spent's one we'll never forget,
            Am
Looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess that
   C
We thought was what made us
                           Am
Ain't it funny now? We can see

We're who we're meant to be

[Chorus]
    C
You still have all of my
    Am
You still have all of my
    Dm         F
You still have all my heart

Instrumental: C Am x2

[Verse 3]
C                                  
  There's too many times I have to say
Am
I could have been better and stronger for you and me
C                       Bm
You always make me feel okay

[Verse 4]
      C
Those late summers we spent, stay up talking all night
              Am
I'd ask, "You think we'd ever make it?"

You'd say, "I'm sure if it's right"
         C                                           
Ain't it funny to think just how stupid I used to be
Am
Hope you always believe

[Chorus] x2
    C
You still have all of my
    Am
You still have all of my
    Dm         F
You still have all my heart

[Bridge]
         Dm
Let them talk and talk and talk
         F
Let them say what they want
        C               
We will laugh at the thought
           G
They don't know what we've got
      Dm                        F
Every year that goes by, a year older we are
                C
You'll still be beautiful then
           G
Bless your beautiful heart

        Dm
They'll talk and talk and talk
    F
How crazy is it?
              C                                  G
Someone could waste their whole life, helplessly,
               Dm            F      
Just patiently waiting for a love like you and me

[Chorus] (x2)
    C
You still have all of my
    Am
You still have all of my
    Dm         F
You still have all my heart

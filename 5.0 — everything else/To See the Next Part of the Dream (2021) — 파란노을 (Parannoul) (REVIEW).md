![[To See the Next Part of the Dream (2021) — 파란노을 (Parannoul).jpg]]

the vocals are drowned out yet not entirely as if it's unintelligible and impossible to understand. the use of electronic bits somehow working and adding a touch of modernity makes it even more unique and distinctly their own than any other shoegaze albums.

***아름다운 세상 (Beautiful World)*** as the first track is probably the best decision made in this album, it sets out the stage for something profoundly melancholic, with dreamy vocals and pianos, as well as the rough yet melodic guitars. it perfectly encapsulates deep-rooted regrets when you were younger, now that you're starting to grow up. you believe your mistakes make up who you are today and you hate yourself for it. it has one of the best euphoric climaxes in any song, despite it having such pessimistic lyrics. it's like reaching a cathartic point of your life, a sudden realization that "oh right, my life is shit" and instead of dealing with it, you succumb to more self-loathing. the chorus, bridge, and first verse all come together to create such beautiful sounds. it's not worth the effort. everyone else is doing great, they're all growing up, and what are you? you're just making an ***변명 (Excuse)*** still, that doesn't justify just lying around and wallowing in self-pity, adding a screaming effect in the song (possibly from *all about lily chou-chou* of course) signifies despair or frustration about how one believes they're such a failure, adopting a victim mindset, further nailing themselves down the hole. reminscing the past, wanting to go back when things were much simpler. ***아날로그 센티멘탈리즘 (Analog Sentimentalism)***, something comparable to an expression of sadness and wistful longing, you know it's bad obsessing over nostalgia, but you can't help it. the ticking of clocks, sounds of numerous alarm clocks, television open and set on a japanese cartoon, the same fucking ***흰천장 (White Ceiling)***, over and over again. a 9-minute musical contemplation about wanting to indulge in escapism, in that same damn room, wanting to stop time, regardless of how shitty of a situation it actually is. but after all, you'll do anything just to avoid interacting with the real world. it's a beautiful world, yet unbearably cruel at the same time, it fills you with a strong sense of melancholy. ***To See the Next Part of the Dream*** is mostly instrumental, a somber plucking of a guitar riff, both acoustic and electric, with people having a conversation in the background. this is a really good time in the album to close your eyes and let your mind float. stop thinking for a few minutes. a moment of clarity amidst all the sadness you've been harnessing and carrying. ***격변의 시대 (Age of Fluctuation)*** takes a turn by introducing the album to more rock-focused sounds in its pool of different genres. as well as more poetic and cryptic lyrics, not as straightforward as those that came before it. personally, this is one of their weaker ones in the album's length because it doesn't resonate as much as i wanted it to. despite my subjectivity, it has some of the most emotional guttural singing in the album's entirety. the angrier spiteful side of the album. a ***청춘반란 (Youth Rebellion)***, someone who can't accept that they've got past being called an adolescent. he's angry at the world, but mostly he's angry at himself for feeling so pathetic and feeling this way. ***엑스트라 일대기 (Extra Story)*** comes in as a quick mellow and hypnotizing breather from the previous track. predicting the future and painting it as something hopeless as what you're feeling now. will it ever change? or are we doomed to experience a cycle of suffering and stagnancy? are we all just extras in someone else's story? because for god's sake, it feels that way. like it wouldn't really matter if i disappeared. ***Chicken*** is like the continuation of the first track, and it's even more mournful and sorrowful. you realize you're nothing more than a coward, a chicken-someone you hate the most. you swore you'll never be like them but here we are, sipping on coffee for breakfast and smoking a cigarette for dinner. however, musically, it does sound more of a goodbye, like you know it's time to go. ***I Can Feel My Heart Touching You*** is trying to dip your toe on the water to determine if it's too hot or too cold. no one's there to tell you which is the case, it's up for you to find out. yearning for a future that isn't so bad, wanting to fly like a bird, hoping for something bigger than yourself.

the songwriter describes how his music is mostly influenced by the following: *all about lily chou-chou*, *welcome to the NHK*, *goodnight punpun*, *neon genesis evangelion*-all of which having a huge impact in my life, too, as a late adolescent and young adult. i'm not gonna detail how each changed the trajectory of my life, but knowing how important these are to me, hopefully makes you realize the magnitude of this album for me, too. a scream to the void, it never offers solutions or answers. we all know childhood and adolescence already happened and it's time to grow up. but every now and then, we cling to emotional immaturity-to whining, complaining, crying, shouting-because we never allowed ourselves to mourn for our lost youth. i guess this is me grieving. a final cry of that of a toddler who lost their parents at a mall, a last scream of that middle schooler who struggles with trying to fit in, but could never do so. an ultimate wail of goodbyes and unacceptance, of identity crisis and finding my place in the world. i'll never be 8, 12, nor 18 years old again.

***Slacker Rock, Singer-Songwriter, Indietronica*** 
*Spoken Word*

largely a song about asexuality or perhaps the complications of discovery of sexuality, desire, pleasure (or the lack thereof). the song opens with just the drums which sounds a bit digital, with will toledo speaking about his emotional outburst regarding his thoughts of having sex with his partner. the reason why, will be expounded throughout the rest of the song. the lyrics *"i wiped my tears on my face and neck and the backs of my ears and said now it's sweat, now it's sweat, it's sweat now*" can be interpreted as a desperate attempt to mimic the aftermath of an exhilarating sexual act which is to perspire. then comes the really catchy bass line which serves as the foundation of the melody for the song; repeated twice, followed by the same riff but with an electric guitar. the first verse combines both guitars and the digitalized-sounding drums. we hear the first signs of sexual dissatisfaction, not just with the lack of feeling pleasure. toledo describes himself as a "sex positive" person, someone who is "cultured" and knows a thing or two about sexual intercourse. but with his current partner, the desire doesn't seem to be present. the things he feel when they're intimate isn't positive. chorus rolls in, "*i can't tell you if i like it, what happens if i don't like it?*" tells us about the fear of opening up to your partner how you don't feel as much pleasure and desire as them during the act, because what would they think? would it be a deal breaker? the first chorus didn't quite finish, as the second verse enters, with another round of spoken word. he talks about how he's been encountering sex blogs and how inclusive they are of all sexuality's experiences but he sees them as all hypothetical and how his situation is very unique. these blogs or the "sex gurus" in today's age fails to see the nuances and specifics of other people's "sex deals" and how it's not a one-size-fits-for-all thing—and so toledo is frustrated by that fact. after this monologue, toledo sings about how his body constantly betrays him—he doesn't feel pleasure when he thinks he's supposed to—and so he tries to fight back i.e. forces to have sex but he only hurts himself; damaging himself or his relationships with other people, or in a way that overexerts his boundaries. the second verse ends, and these weird high pitched "wah-wah" sounds come in, kind of as a comedic effect regarding his situation. another chorus comes, this time in full, and it ends with the line "*it's only sex*" as a reminder to himself that he shouldn't be taking this seriously—yet at the same time, it IS as serious as it gets, and he seems as if he's living in denial with how complicated this sex situation could get. the bridge starts with toledo raising his voice to say "*c'mon sexual desire, speak!*" as he forces to feel some kind of arousal again and again, only to fail again and again, as he sings *"i want to feel your love physically, i want to sleep with you, but only in the literal sense*" he doesn't feel any kind of sexual attraction, perhaps to anyone or only specifically to his partner. the last chorus comprises of a repetition of four with the "*i can't tell you if i like it, what happens if i don't like it*" and ends with the "*it's only sex*" until the song ends, with reverberated guitar strums.

**Capo on 2nd Fret**

[Intro]

A  Em  G  D


[Verse]

Em
All the things that we've lost,
C
Breaking up comes at a cost,
G                        D
I know I'll miss this mistake.

Em
Every word I try to choose,
C
Either way I'm gonna lose,
G                               D
Can't take the "ache" from heartbreak


[Pre-Chorus]

              C
Oh but as you walk away,
          D
You don't hear me say...


[Chorus]

A
Where's the "good" in goodbye?
Em
Where's the "nice" in nice try?
G
Where's the "us" in trust gone?
D
Where's the "soul" in soldier on?
A
Now I'm the "low" in lonely,
Em
Cos I don't own you only,
G
I can take this mistake but,
D
I can't take the "ache" from heartbreak

A Em G

D
No I can't take the "ache" from heartbreak


[Verse]

Em
No matter how it falls apart,
C
There's an "art" in breaking hearts,
G                            D
But there's no "fair" in farewell
Em
When I see you in the street,
C                               G                           D
I pray to God you don't see the silent "hell" in I wish you well


[Pre-Chorus]

              C
Oh but as you walk away,
          D
You don't hear me say...


[Chorus]

A
Where's the "good" in goodbye?
Em
Where's the "nice" in nice try?
G
Where's the "us" in trust gone?
D
Where's the "soul" in soldier on?
A
Now I'm the "low" in lonely,
Em
Cos I don't own you only,
G
I can take this mistake but,
D
I can't take the "ache" from heartbreak


[Bridge]

A                    Em
If I could turn back time
G                          D
Then I would rewrite those lines (x4)


[Chorus]
A

Now I'm the "low" in lonely,

[End Bridge]

A                    Em
If I could turn back time,
G                          D
Then I would rewrite those lines

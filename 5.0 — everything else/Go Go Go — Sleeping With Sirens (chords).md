**CAPO ON 2ND FRET**

INTRO
G G G G

G                ( C )         ( Em )
 We always seem to find a way to fuck things up
     ( D )                  G
 At the worst time, you know
     ( C )          ( Em )   ( D )
 We've never been the smartest

G                      ( C )
 You know you could have anyone
    ( Em )         ( D )         G
 But standing on the edge I said
  ( C )             ( Em ) ( D )
 "I don’t want no one else"

 
 G     C
 They say 
                     Em                    D
 "It’s time to grow up and stop with these foolish games"
     G  C             Em    D
 But I say "They’re wrong"

           Bm       C
 She says "Go, go, go
                 Em       D
 I don’t want to take it slow
                   Bm              C              Em
 There’s plenty of time for us to finally get it right
               D
 Why don't we crash and burn tonight?"

G
 (Why don't we crash and burn tonight?)
    C          G G G G
 So pick it up!


G               ( C )              ( Em )
 Shoulda known we were too young to feel this much
      ( D )                 G
 It could kill us, you know
( C )      ( Em ) ( D )
 My nearly departed

G              ( C )            ( Em )
 Said you were corrupting me, I was naive
     ( D )      G
 But no one knew
 ( C )        ( Em ) ( D )
 I kept it to myself


 G     C
 They say 
                     Em                    D
 "It’s time to grow up and stop with these foolish games"
     G  C             Em    D
 But I say "They’re wrong"

           Bm       C
 She says "Go, go, go
                 Em       D
 I don’t want to take it slow
                   Bm              C              Em
 There’s plenty of time for us to finally get it right
               D                   C  C
 Why don't we crash and burn tonight?"

       
 C       G                 Bm    C
 This is how we'll always be, yeah!
 C             C      G                   D      C *
 They'll see we were right and they were wrong, oh
                          D *
 So I'll put it in a song
                        G G G G
 And you can sing along

C          G      ( C )            ( Em )   ( D ) 
 She said "Go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow"
           G      ( C )            ( Em )   ( D )
 She said "Go, go, go, I don't wanna take it slow", oh


 G        C
 Go, go, go
                 Em       D
 I don’t want to take it slow
                   G               C              Em
 There’s plenty of time for us to finally get it right
               D                   G    G     
 Why don't we crash and burn tonight?

G             G                     **
 Why don't we crash and burn tonight?

[Verse]
A7 
Everyone… Bubblegum…
Dm
I’m so dumb… I should have just told you… 
  A7                             Dm
what I lost was a piece of your hair!
 A7
Now it’s gone, gone forever,
 Dm
but I guess, what does it matter?
  A7                                 Dm
When I just... just had all of you there.
Bb     Bb                   F                 A7
Oh, I just had all of you there with me, my friends...
                     Dm
if you’re even my friends.
        Bb                F 
What am I to you? Am I a joke, your knight, or your brother?
        Bb                     F
What am I to you? Do you look down on me 'cause I’m younger?
C        Bb                          F
Do you think that I don’t understand?
                    Bb                          F
I just wanted us together and to play as a band,
                    Bb                    F
Last night was the most fun I've ever had,
                        Bb                   F          A7
Even liked it when the two of you would get mad at each other.
    Bb           F       C                   Bb
Oh, you, a-a-a-a-are my best friends in the world.
            F       C                   Bb
You A-A-A-A-are my best friends in the world.
                    F         C                        Bb
And that’s ri-i-i-i-ight I’m talking about the two of you girls.
     Dm      
And you, Jake.
F                                    A7
 I wanna sing a song to you and I refuse to make it fake.
        Bb                F                           C
What am I to you? Am I a joke, your knight, or your brother?
        Bb                     F                     C
What am I to you? Do you look down on me 'cause I'm younger?
         Bb                      F
Do you think that I don't understand?
                    Bb                      F
I just wanted us together and to play as a band,
                    Bb                   F
I'll forget that I lost a piece of your hair,
                   Bb             F              A7
I'll remember the pasta that we shared... over there.
   G   C           G       D                   C
Ah ah, you a-a-a-a-are my best friends in the world.
            G       D                   C
You A-A-A-A-are my best friends in the world.
                    G          D                          C
And that's ri-i-i-i-ight, I'm talking about the two of you girls,
    Em
And you, Jake.
G                                      B7
 I'm gonna sing a song to you and I refuse to make it fake.
 Em         C
Make no mistake,
                  G                  B7                    Em
I'm gonna sing a song that feels so real, it'll make this do-o-o-or break!

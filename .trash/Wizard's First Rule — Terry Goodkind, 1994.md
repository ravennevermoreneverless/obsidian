### Chapter 1
The first chapter already tells us that Richard is closest to his father, who died a mysterious death and he's distant with his brother Michael. Zedd seems to be an important character, too. Richard is curious, sharp, and a man of the woods. He encountered 3 peculiar things; a vine-rotting infestation, a big red entity in the woods, and a woman being stalked by 4 men. 
### Chapter 2
Richard and Kahlan miraculously survived the 4 deadly men, who all died. The first instance of unexplainable magic appears — from Kahlan, who apparently came past the boundary, from the Midlands. This is a place of magic, the boundary is extremely dangerous. But dangerous people are affer Kahlan, and I believe Richard will make it his duty to protect her, seeing how beautifully written their intense connection is. Kahlan stays suspicious and guarded, as if trying to hide something.
### Chapter 3
Kahlan remains suspicious even in Hartland. Michael gives a speech intended to move audience—he used the story of how their mother died in a fire—Richard got angry but he was taught to suppress it. Michael violates and sexually assaults Kahlan.

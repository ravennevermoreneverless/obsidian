```[Verse 1] 

E      B                  F#m        A 
 Tired, tired, you're all I want, yeah
      E                        B 
It'll be 'til the end, give me nothing I've ever tried
             F#m                             A
It'll be the perfect sin, something like the truest lie
     E                       B      
Everywhere somehow, the only place I'll ever be 
               F#m                      A
As long as you hold me down, oh such a liberty


[Pre-Chorus]

 C#m                     E                        F#m
Warm me with your touch, pressure from your fingertips
 C#m             E                      F#m
Never be enough, I'll do nothing but submit


[Chorus]

E             B                         F#m       A
I just wanna feel a thousand hands from you, only you
E                B                         F#m       A
Can you make me feel a thousand hands from you, only you?


[Verse 2]

       E                           B                                               
Grab a hold of my soul and make me feel complete
                     F#m                          A
Within you'll be the one to show these goosebumps on my skin
             E                                 B
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve, I need you to feel the pain
                 F#m                                A
Would you take a bullet for me? Cause you know I'll do the same


[Pre-Chorus]

 C#m                     E                        F#m
Warm me with your touch, pressure from your fingertips
 C#m             E                       F#m
Never be enough, I'll do nothing but submit


[Chorus]

E             B                         F#m       A
I just wanna feel a thousand hands from you, only you
E                B                         F#m           A
Can you make me feel a thousand hands from you, and only you?


[Outro]

E                       B              F#m
I just want to feel a thousand, from you
                      A
A thousand hands from you
       E     B       E
Just wanna feel a thousand
                F#m
A thousand hands from you
                     A
Feel a thousand hands from you

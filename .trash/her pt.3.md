Tonight I dreamt of you for the last time. 

The image of you leapt at my defenseless gaze from the bridge between phantasm and reality. You were standing there beside the glass pillars that I've always associated your name with. You were looking so soft and still so unconventionally pretty. 

In this dream, we locked eyes and felt a painful understanding. No words were exchanged as we tip toed in that humid room filled with vines and familiarity. We go about our ways but you were never within my sight and reach—you're either far away in front of me or behind me, but never beside me. 

'Cause all you ever were was a gust of jaded mist passing by, caressing my burning skin trying to soothe the intensity of my foreboding. It was quick and it never did much but I wanted the icy touch of the mist. But it wasn't what I needed.

So I asked myself what could a mist do that can satiate the hunger of the fire that I cultivated from the depths of my fantasies? Nothing really happens if the mist and fire interact—there are no sparks or collisions of a thousand dying stars. All I can do is reach out my hand but my touch will just go right through you.

The whole time I was chasing after an idea. Wearing these rose-colored glasses, looking at a promising future that doesn't even exist. It was a harmless thing until I realized I wanted to fall in love. But I didn't. God, I'm so glad I didn't.

You made me realize that I'm capable of a lot of things; of wanting. Of trying. Of not giving up. Of being happy. But most of all I realized that I'm capable of deserving better. 

A vague dream, a distant memory, a lover from a different timeline.

Words left unsaid, things left undone, an unfinished work of art.

Did we make the right choice? Did you ever really want this? 

Was I too much? Or were you just too little?

You know, maybe if life allows it,

I'll be able to hold your hand. 

But until then,

let's just stay in our neverland.

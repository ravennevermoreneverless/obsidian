So, it's been a while since I last wrote here. My previous entry is a disaster and I can tell how unstable I was back then. And that was, almost 2 years ago? I was in a very unpleasant phase and it was uncontrollable. But now, I'm a bit rational and more.. developed? Let's just say my condition has improved and I'm aware of my actions and emotions. I was never good with words and not very articulate in expressing my emotions, or just plainly writing. I suck at words.

It's kind of difficult typing on my laptop right now, I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm not used to it? Right now, I should be watching Mob Psycho 100 but I felt like writing down what's on my mind right now. I feel like going back to writing my dreams but lately I kept forgetting my dreams the moment I wake up.

Lately, I've been hyper aware of airplanes and helicopters passing by. I've been paranoid of the possibility of those crashing down and hitting the city. I know it's probably one out of a million chance of that happening but my anxiety won't leave me alone. Also, I've been paranoid of the new pathological virus spreading around the world which originated from China; Coronavirus. It's infectious and very lethal but currently, the cure and its origins are unknown. I just hope none of us catch the virus because we are living in a tough and unfair world.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I stopped school, to recover from years worth of depression and bipolarity (yes, I'm diagnosed). Ain't that sweet? Never in my life would I even think of myself dropping out but here we are. I know I should face the consequences of my decision and I'm aware of how much I'm missing out and the idea of me getting left behind. Yes, I know. But these past few months was just lovely. I needed this freedom and relaxation. I'm gonna make every month worthwhile. A few more months and I'll go back to school. To a new school. To a new life, new people, new friends and new goals, preferably if I find a purpose and what I want in life. Right now, I've just been focused on my hobbies and making my mind better. Trying to practice and enhance my focus and concentration. I shouldn't put pressure on myself, thinking I should be doing something meaningful right now. It doesn't matter. I keep telling myself to do what I like to do and just continue doing it. Live in the present. Try to forget worries about the future and the shadows of the past. Experience life and its wonders.

Try and be happy.

Raven.

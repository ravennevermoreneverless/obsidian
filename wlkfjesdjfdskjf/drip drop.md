Drip drop, the rain goes

As I watched you walk away from me.

Drip drop, the rain falls

As you took every step on the cold wet pavements,

still away from me.

Drip drop, the rain drops

As my body's drenched from head to toe,

you're still walking away from me.

Drip drop, the rain says

As the clock ticks along with the last beats of my heart,

why are you still walking away from me?

Drip drop, the rain slides

As I've always worn my heart on my sleeves but now you have it in your pockets,

please come back to me.

Drip drop, the rain slows

As I watched you from the distance, never looking back,

please stay with me.

Drip drop, the rain stops

As I realized,

just as the last of the dark grey clouds lets in the bits of sunshine,

that you're not coming back to me.

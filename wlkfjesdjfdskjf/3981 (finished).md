That night, April 20, whatever time was that, was the end of something that wasn't even there and the start to something that will teach me the ways of life.

I admit those words that glared at me through my phone screen was enough for my life to come crashing down at my feet. It was enough to tell me. As if saying, 'it's over.'. I was speechless. Well, actually, speechless was an understatement. I was flabbergasted, couldn't say a word. But I knew. I knew then that eventually it would end up like that. I just accepted what was coming right at me and I let it come at me. I didn't regret anything. I wanted things to continue but it seems like she didn't, and so I let her have her way. I remember perfectly the conversation we had, the words we exchanged.

"Are you two together now?"

"No." _..._ "No, we aren't together but my feelings for him are coming back."

"Ahh, I see." "You were with him yesterday, right?" _And the day before._

"Yeah, how did you know?"

"I just know." _He posted your picture together, dummy._ "You two look great together, y'know."

"Thanks."

"So..what now? Stop this?"

"I suppose so.."

"I guess this is it then."

"I know right."

"Thanks for being honest."

You haven't replied to me that day and I understood. It was hard. How I asked if we had to stop. It hurt. You didn't have a violent reaction and you accepted. I just knew then.. it was over. Not a single tear was shed and I was beyond shocked, maybe it didn't really have that effect on me more than expected.

It sucked though. The tomorrow after that day was the time I get to meet you again after 2 weeks. I was so excited, I'd have to see your face again. Your breathtaking smile, your beautiful long-lashed eyes and I'd get to hold you again. I just knew we'd spend the whole day together after the enrollment but I guess luck just wasn't on my side.

~~

April 21, I was staring at you from afar. You were so beautiful, until now. I watched you laugh with your friends, walk here and there with that glam you always carry. You dress so fabulously and I loved it.

"Are you okay?" A friend laid a hand on my shoulder, looking at me with those concerned and sympathetic smile.

I gave her a reassuring yet sad smile, gripping your pendant on my right hand.

It's funny the history we had on those pendants. We surprisingly had that same crystal pendant but with different colors. Mine was blue, yours was pink. It was those corny 'month pendants' you buy along the streets and it just so happens I unconsciously bought the 'October' one. Your birthmonth. We exchanged pendants and promised to return it right after school ends but we never did return it. We were so attached to those pendant that we didn't mind possessing each other's. Well, until now, I guess.

I couldn't afford to give it to you personally. I'm afraid I'd crumble right in front of you and break down, crying my lungs out so I asked my friend to give it back to you, her perfectly understanding and without retorting. 

I wasn't surprised when she gave it back to me but also with the courtesy of her friend. Her friend looked at me knowingly with those sad eyes while handing me the blue pendant. After giving gratitude towards her, I immediately pocketed it. I didn't have the heart to see it yet. Just not now when I know she's eyeing me from the distance.

On the way home, I got a message from you, saying thanks. I perfectly knew that she was saying thanks for giving back the pendant but I just have to ask.

"For what?"

"For everything and for the pendant. :)"

_..._  "Are you regretting it?"

"Regretting what?"

"This. Us. Everything that has happened."

"When we were together?"

"Yes. Aren't you regretting everything? That your time was wasted?"

"Nope. I was happy."

"I'm glad." _I'm not glad._ "Why did you even stay?" _Why didn't you stay?_

"I stayed because what I said, I was happy."

"Good. Thank you, really. Just so you know... I really loved you." _And I still do._

"Thanks." _And you never said you did, too._

That same day, I had this hideous dark cloud above me yet I never cried. I never showed I was beyond crushed. I was unaware of myself slowly dying inside. I laughed and laughed, smiled throughout the rest of the day and got crazy with my siblings. I really thought I was happy.

~~

April 22. I was better. I was all smiles when I woke up. Even hung out with my siblings in the living room; playing games and watching TV. It helped me clear my mind even for just a bit. My day was going better when Mom arrived with that huge tub of my favorite ice cream. I was pretty content for the rest of the day. That was, until...

_"One message received from Tiffany. 9:58 PM"_

"Sleep now."

I didn't want to reply. I just didn't want to. Why were you texting me? I thought it was over, what now? I want to ignore you but I have this strong urge not to, and so I did what my heart is telling me to.

"Why? Haha it's still early."

"It's late, you have to sleep. Have you eaten dinner yet?"

"Not yet." _I haven't eaten all day._ "You?"

"Of course. Go eat now. Don't skip meals, it's unhealthy."

"It's okay, I'm not hungry."

"It's bad. You can't go to sleep with an empty stomach. :("

"I'm fine. Don't mind me."

"Just go eat, Taetae."

"Just go sleep, Tiffany."

"Not yet. I'm on my way home right now."

"What? Where are you?"

"Just off with some friends. But we're leaving now."

_"A picture was received. 10:09 PM."_

_Ah. You're still as beautiful as ever. But why? Why would you send me a picture of you? Wait.. is she in a bar right now, seriously?_

"You're drinking? Are you drunk right now?"

"No, well wait... Maybe. I think so hehe."

"You shouldn't drink much. Please take care and be careful going home." _I still care._

"I will. ^_^"

I was torn. I didn't reply. I knew we would end up chatting for the whole night about everything and anything but I didn't want that. Not with the situation we have right now and obviously not after what happened the day before. I may have the slightest idea why you would have texted; it's because you were drunk. But why were you drinking? I remember perfectly well the reasons you laid out why you would be out drinking. It's either you're sad, trying to forget something or there's an occasion. I didn't know which was the reason but I could care less. I just knew at that moment, I needed someone to vent my feeling out and someone to talk to, someone to cheer me up.

I was laying on my bed, locked inside my room. The lights were out, the silence was deafening; only the sound of the AC was all I could hear. My limbs are sprawled out on the bed. I was staring at the ceiling, not a care in the world. I just didn't know what to do and what to think. I was so goddamn tired for whatever reason; I didn't even do anything.

Then suddenly, my mind automatically thought of _her._ Her with me. Her with everything between us. Her sleeping. Her laughing. Her smiling. Her wearing my shirt. Her cuddling with me. Her kissing me. Her whispering to my ears; 'I won't ever leave you.'. Her saying; 'I love you.'

Then it hit me. It hit me like a hundred-thousand-pound firetruck with the speed of fucking light. It struck me like a lightning in a thunderstorm, leaving me electrified and paralyzed all over. Realization hit me. Reality hit me like a bitch. And fuck, how it hurt.

And without knowing, streaming warm tears ran down the side of my face, along the curve of my cheekbone, along my ears and hit the comforts of the bed. It kept coming and coming and I did nothing to stop it. I'm feeling choked up. My throat hurts like there was something stuck on it. I didn't want to sob for I didn't want them to hear me bawling my eyes out and shit. I finally cried.

Just right on the goddamn time, my friends texted me at once. I didn't want to talk to them at the moment, considering the endless flow of wet tears but I just needed to let it out or else, I would've gone crazy with these thought bubbling in my head and emotions pooling inside. It was just all over the place and I needed to iron myseld out. And thank God, they were here.

_"One message received from Soonkyu ;) 12:10 AM"_

"I heard what happened. Are you okay?"

"I thought I was, Sun. That is, I **only** thought I was okay."

"Jesus, Taeng, don't tell me you're crying right now?"

"It hurts, Soonkyu."

"Yeah, of course it would hurt like hell if you keep thinking about it and all the memories you both shared, so stop."

"Fuck. She is the only person that I loved like this. This is irritating, fuck, it hurts. We were at that point that we were so happy, Soonkyu."

"Just seriously, stop thinking about those memories, c'mon. It will obviously worsen the situation."

"It's hard not to think about it."

"Just don't. But it's okay to cry though. It's perfectly fine, just let it all out. Well, until you realize you look stupid crying your eyes out kekeke."

"Haha thanks, Sunbun. :) Thanks for being concerned. You should sleep now, goodnight."

Our conversation ended like that. I felt a little better knowing a friend is there when I needed them but the tears just won't stop falling down. My thoughts getting intense and my line of memories just kept increasing and coming, it won't stop. I was crying like there's no tomorrow, biting my lower lips to keep the sobs from coming out. I felt like a kid who lost her most favorite toy in the world and couldn't ever bring it back. I felt useless and weak. But I just couldn't help it, I love her. I love Tiffany.

_"One message received from BroYul, 12:23 AM"_

"Hey dude. I can't sleep. What's up?"

"Oh, nothing. Just crying."

"Wow, great. Why?" "Shit, this is about Tifffany, right?"

"Sorry. I just thought I was alright with everything. I don't know. It's just now that I have realized everything." "Shit, my tears won't stop."

"Tsk, I knew it. I'm sorry I'm not there to hug you, as gay as it sounds lol. I know how it hurts. It's normal to cry, y'know. Don't rush on things, Taeng. Wait 'til you heal but it takes time. It won't immediately fade. But after that, you will just laugh when you remember this. Don't worry, just cry. To lessen the weight of the pain." "Let it out bro, I'm listening."

"Haha yea, thanks. :) Maybe this is why I felt so heavy all day. I can't tell anything, my mind's in a jumble. I'm still crying, I can't stop it. I'm literally sobbing lol."

"Don't stop the feeling, my gay friend."

"I hate myself for not being enough. For her. I'm mad at myself. For my shortcomings. I was ready to give her everything, where did I do wrong?"

"Shit, Taeng. Don't give me that pity card. You never did have shortcomings. It's more than okay that you gave her your everything. At least, you won't blame yourself because you know you did it. You showed her how much you love her." "It's just that way. There are always those people that don't know how to be contented. If you really love her, let her go. Let her realize what she has thrown away. Be happy because you know that she is happy, with him. We chose to love even though we know, it would hurt. You learned a lesson or two in this. You're almost perfect, Taeng. But not all times that is what love is based on. So cheer up now. :)"

"What is this sorcery.. KWON YURI! You just made me cry more, you jerk. :'(" "I don't know what triggered me more with your words but damn it, IT WON'T STOP."

"Dude! What do you want me to do then? Should I just punch you to knock some sense into you? GEEZ. lol"

"Hahahahaha sorry" "But thanks, though. Because you're there.. even though you made my condition worse lmao"

"My pleasure, young padawan. ;) I'm sorry, too for making you cry more like a kid lol. But seriously, Tiffany's not the only girl out there, Taeng, just so you know."

"I know that."

"Good. I'm so cute lol. Wanna take a shot or a few?"

"Nah, I think I'll pass, thanks. :]"

"Suit yourself. Goodnight then, don't dwell too much. You're still young, kid."

"What! You're younger than me, you!"

"kekekekkeke night night!"

That lifted some part of my spirit up. Just a random talk with my main man, Yuri and it solved some parts. I couldn't be more thankful of hers and Sunny's existence. Oh, what would I do without those two who cared and acted like my parents?

It was hard keeping things at bay and controlling my feelings that whole hour, but really, crying helped A LOT. Now, I was actually afraid if I have kept bottling it up inside. I would've exploded eventually somewhere or worse, on someone. With those thoughts still in my mind, my eyes dry and tired from all the release it got, I eventually fell asleep and dreamt of her and what we could've been.

~~

April 23, I woke up dry as the season, Summer. I almost immediately ran to the fridge to gobble up tons of water. I eventually felt my stomach complain. I couldn't even remember the last time I got hungry but I'm just glad. That crying fiasco last night sure did helped a lot and stopped me from being all sentimental and deppressed over Tiffany. Now, here I am at the kitchen, swallowing every food that came in sight. Damn, how it felt real good to eat again. I felt like I haven't eaten for weeks.

In the middle of eating, I felt my phone vibrate.

_"One message received from Shin-oppa, 3:10 PM"_

"Hey kiddo, How're you?"

Shin-oppa is a very special oppa of mine. I met him in LINE App. He was somewhat serious when I first met him but along the months, he's actually such a dork. I didn't even know how we stayed as friends and got closer though I like him but not in **that** way. He's eventually became like a real brother of mine. We seldom talk since he would always be busy with work and he would be tired all the time. Despite this, he has helped me a lot everytime I'd get problems with sleeping or with eating and other things but never with my lovelife.

"Oppa..I'm back to being nocturnal."

"Oh? Why?"

"I dunno, I just do."

"I see. How are you feeling?"

"Always tired. And really tired eyes lol. I feel sleepless even though I sleep a lot."

"You know, Taengoo, they said sleeping a lot means you're sad. Are you?"

"Oh, I didn't know that... Actually, I am."

"You know you can talk to me, right? :)"

"Well..do you remember Tiffany?"

"Of course. The love of your life, quote unquote. ;)"

"We're over. Her feelings for her ex-boyfriend came back."

"Oh.. That's.. I'm sorry to hear that."

"Haha yeah, it's okay. I'm feeling a little better actually right after I dried my eyeballs out lol."

"Do you know the saying 'out of sight, out of mind?'"

"I've heard it before.. but not exactly sure what it actually meant.."

_"A picture was received, 3:16 PM"_

-

"Do you want to move on from her, Taengoo?"

"Yeah.."

"You can use that concept."

"You saying I should change university? lmao"

"If you can, why not? LOL" "No, not that big change. Start with not hearing anything about her. If she messaged you like nothing happened. Block her. If she's treating you as if like nothing happened, then do it that way." "It's not being bitter like what others think, it's a way of helping yourself. If you don't do that, you'd be stuck in the same place."

"Ah.. I see. I guess, I should go do that. :]"

"And I also don't believe in what others say about being friends after a relationship ended. That's pure bullshit imo."

"Haha yes, that's true."

"Like what John Mayer sang: 'Friends, lovers or nothing. There can only be one.'"

"Always a John Mayer fan, I see. Hahaha"

"Oh and before you start with the moving on process.. you NEED to 'Say what you need to say' to her." "That's John Mayer's song Say. LOL"

"She might not care though.. of what I would say."

"Say it! Haha! We don't care if she'd care, just get it off your chest. Fighting, Kim Taengoo! > w < 9"

"Haha, oppa, you dork. Okay, wait, lemme just eat first." "Thanks, Shin-oppa. You're the best." _Seriously, I couldn't be more thankful._

"You know I'm the best. Now, go John Mayer your way out of this haha!"

--

So, I took his advice. God, how I did. I left my thoughts and doubts at the back of my head. She agreed to meet me at a cafe down the street and now we're face to face. I took in a huge gulp of air and said what I had to say. It was now or never.

"Tiffany, I love you."

--

Days become weeks, weeks become months and months become years. It's been 6 years since that same night that broke my heart and shattered it into pieces. But in that 6 years that has passed, I've grown with it, learned a lot of things and here I am.. I survived.

I was scrolling through my Facebook when suddenly..

_"Tiffany Hwang sent you a friend request, 4:10 PM"_

Oh.

That was yesterday.

Did I forgot to mention the you blocked me in that whole 6 years of moving on? I admit, it helped but I never knew the reason why you did that.

Then now? Why now? I was hugely baffled by that stunt you pulled. I have moved on, I can confidently say that without wavering. But I don't think I'm ready to be, even in a platonic friendship relationship with you. Not now, not ever.

My friends say 'bah, you haven't moved on at all.', 'bah, you're being immature.'. I just smile at them and shake my head. Not confirming a friend request doesn't mean I still love her.

I chuckle to myself as I sip my coffee. Sitting on this office chair and typing down my thoughts in this laptop on my desk.

Loving someone doesn't always mean you get to keep them by your side. Loving someone doesn't mean..possession. It doesn't always mean you get the prize and you live happily ever after. No. And I've learned to accept that at a young age. For loving someone..can also mean setting them free and letting them be happy. Sure, it hurted like a motherfucker and it still does sting a bit when I remember all those nights we shared and all those days we spent, but then that's it. I've long accepted what has become of you and of me.

Tiffany, if you're reading this, I just want to thank you for letting me be a part of the journey that you call your life. You're the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

And oh, congratulations on giving birth to a beautiful baby boy.

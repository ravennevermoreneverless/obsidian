## 文法

### 1. Past Tense Short Forms

- Verbs in the affirmative:
	— replace て/で in て-forms with た/だ
- Verbs in the negative:
	— replace い in the present tense negative ない with かった
- い-adjectives (both in the affirmative and negative) and な-adjectives and noun + です in the negative
	— drop the final です in the long forms
- な-adjectives and noun + です in the affirmative
	— replace でした in the long forms with だった

The two irregularities are:
行く => 行った
いい => よかった 、よくなかった

### 2. Qualifying Nouns with Verbs and Adjectives

The short forms of verbs can be used to qualify nouns, much like adjectives can. 

Example:
==あそこで本を読んでいる==学生はみちこさんです
The student ==who is reading a book over there== is Michiko. 

Other phrase examples:
1. *==おもしろい==人* a person ==who is interesting==
2. *==髪が長い==人* a person ==who has long hair==
3. *==めがねをかけている==人* a person ==who wears glasses==
4. *==猫が好きな==人* a person ==who likes cats=

More examples:
	*あそこで写真撮っている人(はだれですか)* (Who is) the person taking pictures over there?
	*舞日運動をする人(は元気です)* People who do physical exercises every day (are healthy.) 
	*たばこを吸わない人(が好きです)* (I like) people who do not smoke. 
	*去年結婚した友達(から手紙が来ました)* (A letter came from) a friend who got married last year. 

### 3. まだ~ていません

(1) Zelda has lost her key — present perfect, event as something that is connected with the present 
(2) Zelda lost her key — simple past, event as something thag is independent of the situation at the present moment

In Japanese, past tense forms do double duty on the affirmative end of polarity, but the past tense and the ている construction share the work on the negative end. In the affirmative, past tense is used both with words like きのう (disconnected from the present) and もう ("already", connected with present). 

*私はきのう宿題をしました* I did the homework yesterday.
*私はもう宿題をしました* I have already done the homework.

With the negative, the past is used to talk about a finished time period like きのう, but ている is used if your intention is to talk about how things stand now ("not yet").

*私はきのう宿題をしませんでした* I did not do the homework yesterday
*私はまだ宿題をしていません* I have not done the homework yet. 

>*まだ~ていません* have not...yet

This use of ている can be found both with verbs describing *changes* and with verbs describing *activities*. 

Examples:
	*スーさんはまだ起きていません* Sue has not woken up yet. 
	*私はまだ昼ご飯を食べていません* I haven't eaten lunch yet. 

### 4. ~から

>*(explanation) から, (situation)* (situation), because (explanation). / (explanation), therefore, (situation). 

Examples:
	*あした試験があるから、私は今晩勉強します* I will study this evening, because we will have an exam tomorrow. 
	*寒かったら、出かけませんでした* It was cold, therefore, we didn't go out. 

Before the conjunction から, you find both the long and short forms. The long form before から is more polite, and is frequentl found in request and suggestion sentences. 

*かぶきの切符がありますから、一緒に見に行きましょう* Let's go to see Kabuki. I have tickets.

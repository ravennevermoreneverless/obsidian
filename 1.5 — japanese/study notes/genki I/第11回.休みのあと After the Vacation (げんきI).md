## 文法

### 1. ~たい

You can use a verb stem + たいです to describe your hope or aspiration. 
>*verb stem + たいです* I want to do...

Examples:
	*今度の週末は、映画を見たいです* I want to see a film this weekend.
	*いつか中国に行きたいです* I want to go to China someday.

The combination of a verb and たい conjugates as an い-adjective. 

Examples: 
	*あの人には会いたくないです* I don't want to see that person.
	*セーターが買いたかったから、デパートに行きました* I went to a department store, because I wanted to buy a sweater. 

If your wish is one you have entertained for some time, if you "have wanted to", you can use たいと思っています instead of たいです.

Somebody else's wishes are usually reported in Japanese either as quotations, observations, or guesses. So, to quote somebody saying that she wants to do something, you can use と言っていました with たい.

Example:
	*メアリーさんはチベットに行きたいと言っていました* Mary said she wanted to go to Tibet. 

To describe your observation that somebody wants to do something, you must use a special verb たがっている instead of たい. Here, we only use を compared to when using たい where we can both use が or を.

Example:
	*メアリーさんは着物を着たがっています* (It seems) Mary wants to wear a kimono. 

This comes from the dictionary form たがる (which conjugates as an う-verb) which indicates "I think she wants to, because of the way she is behaving."

### 2. ~たり~たりする

If you want to list down examples of activities, in no set order and not everything in one sentence, you can use a special predicate form ~たり~たりする.

Example:
	*大阪で買い物をしたり、晩ご飯を食べたりします* In Osaka, I will do such things as shopping, and eating dinner. 

>*(activity A)たり (activity B)たりする* do such things as A and B

To get the たり form of a predicate, just add り to the past tense short form of a predicate. The helping verb する at the end of the sentence indicates the tense of the sentence. 

Examples: 
	*週末は、勉強したり、友達と話したりしました* I studied and talked with my friends, among other things, over the weekend.
	*踊ったり、音楽を聞いたりするのが好きです* I like dancing, listening to music, and so forth.

### 3. ~ことがある

The past tense short form of a verb + ことがある describes that you did something, or something happened, in earlier times. 

>*verb (short, past, affirmative) + ことがある* have the experience of... 

Examples:
	*富士山に登ったことがあります* I have had the experience of climbing Mt. Fuji.
	*たけしさんは授業を休んだことがありません* Takeshi has never been absent from classes (in his life). 

### 4. noun A や noun B

や connects two nouns like と but や suggests the things referred to are proposed as examples, and that you are not citing an exhaustive list. 
>*AやB* A and B, for example

Example:
	*京都や奈良に行きました*　I went to Kyoto and Nara (for example, and may have visited other places as well). 

##### 表現ノート
- ***は in negafive sentences*** — In negative sentences, you often find the particle は where you expect が or を. They are still correct but the Japanese find は versions more natural. The rule of thumb ks that negative Japanese sentences tend to contain at least one は phrase. は may also follow particles like で and に. 
	Examples:
		*英語では話したくないです* I don't want to speak in English.
		*広島には行ったことがありません* I have never been to Hiroshima. 
- ***だけ*** — You can add だけ to numbers to talk about having just that many items. だけ implies that you have something up to the amount you needed, but not more than that. This suggests that you can live with that few, though the number admittedly could have been higher. 
- ***に*** — You can use the particle に to indicate the occasion on which you do something.
	Example:
		*晩ご飯にサラダを食べました* I ate salad at dinner
	に can also indicate the role you want something to play.
	Example:
		*お土産に絵葉書を買いました* I bought a postcard as a souvenir. 
- ***ドライブ*** — is used when you go somewhere by car for pleasure. To say "to have a drive" or "to go fo a drive", use ドライブに行く or ドライブする. When you simply want to say "to drive a car" (not necessarily for pleasure), you use 運転する instead.
- ***夢*** — This has two meanings: (1) the dream you have while sleeping, (2) the dream you wish would come true. To say, "I have a dream" in Japanese, you use the verb 見る for sleeping dreams, and 持っている or ある for your visions.
- ***には*** — The particle は often follows the particle に in sentences describing a place in terms of the things that are found there.
	(1) *東京にはデパートがたくさんあります*
	(2) *東京にデパートががくさんあります*
	There are many department stores in Tokyo. 

	There is a subtle difference between the two sentences. The first sentence is about the places; they answer questions like "What is Tokyo like?" The second sentence is an answer to a question like "Where do you find many department stores?"

###### Culture Note
###### お正月 [New Year's]

New Year's Eve is called 大晦日, and people try to finish their seasonal chores — cleaning the house thoroughly, writing greeting cards (年賀状), and so on — by this date. Dinner for New Year's Eve often includes 年越しそば (buckwheat noodles), as the long noodles symbolzie the desire for longevity. 

When saying goodbye to someone who you do not expect to see again until the new year, the traditional parting phrase is よいお年を (Have a Happy New Year!). When you meet somebody for the first time in the new year, you say あけましておめでとうございます (Happy New Year!) 

Many people go to 神社 (Shinto shrines) and お寺 (Buddhist temples) for 初詣 or the "first worship of the year", which is likely to be their only visit to shrines and temples for the year, since Japan is a largely secular society. 

Special dishes called お節料理 are eaten for New Year's. Each dish is said to signify a particular wish — black beans (黒豆) for diligence and health (a pun on the word まめ), herring roe (数の子) for having many offspring, and so forth. The staple food for New Year's is おもち (rice cake), which is toasted or served in 雑煮 (New Year's soup). 

Children expect to receive お年玉 which are gifts of money from their parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and even family guests.

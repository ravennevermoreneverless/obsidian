## 文法

### 1. Short Forms

![[short forms (japanese).jpg]]

The following rules summarize how short forms are constructed: 
![[japanese short forms rules.jpg]]

Verbs in the negative conjugate differently.

Verbs in the negative have a few notes:
(1) The negative short forms of verbs that end with う are ~わない instead of ~あない.
(2) The vowel changes with the irregular verbs する and くる. 
(3) The verb ある in the negative ない, as in かさがない (there is no umbrella). 

### 2. Informal Speech

Speaking with short form sentences show a sign of intimacy. The use of long forms implies the speaker's intention to "keep a proper distance" from the listener. It's like using Mr./Mrs. in contrast to first name basis.

Japanese people are often very conscious of seniority. There is no "equal" relationship in speech. A senior might use informal speech to a junior but the junior cannot do the same. 

- In casual conversational use of short forms, question sentences do not end with the question particle か, but with rising intonation alone.
- The だ ending of な-adjectives and noun + です constructions is usually dropped at the very end of a sentence, or is followed by sentence-final ね or よ.
- In casual conversations, はい and いいえ are usually replaced by the less formal うん and ううん. 

### 3. ~と思います/~と言っていました

To quote a person's utterance or thoughts, you use a clause with a predicate in the short form, plus と思います (I think that...), と言っていました (They said "..."), and so forth, と is a quotation particle, which does the job of both the English word "that" in indirect quotation and of quotation marks (" ") in direct quotation.

Examples:
	*スーさんは、あした試験があると言っていました* Sue said that there would be an exam tomorrow. 
	*(私は) たけしさんはメアリーさんが好きだと思います* I think Takeshi likes Mary. 

### 4. ~ないでください

To request that someone refrain from doing something, one can use a negative verbal short form plus でください.

Example:
	*ここで写真を撮られないでください* Please don't take pictures here. 

>*negative short form + でください* Please don't 

### 5. verb のが好きです

~が好きです expresses the idea that you like something (a thing). Add の to a verbal short form to now express the idea of "doing x."

Examples:
	*(私は)日本語を勉強するのが好きです* I like studying the Japanese language.
	*(私は) 部屋を掃除すのがきらいです* I don't like cleaning my room. 

"To be good/bad at doing something" is ~が上手です (is good at...) and ~が下手です (is bad at...). 

Examples: 
	*ロバートさんじゃ料理を作るのが上手です* Robert is good at cooking meals. 
	*たけしさんは英語を話すのが下手です* Takeshi is not a good speaker of English. 

### 6. が

The functions of が:
(1) present the subject of a sentence in such a way that 
(2) the noun will "fill in the blank on the information sheet"

The "blank on the information sheet" is a question word like だれ and 何.

Examples:
	Q: *どのクラスがおもしろいですか* Which class is (the most) interesting?
	A: *日本語のクラスがおもしろいです* Japanese class is.
	Q: *(このクラスで)だれがめがねをかけていますか* Wh wears glasses (in this class)?
	A: *山下先生がめがねをかけています* Professor Yamashita does.

### 7. 何か and 何も

>positive statements: *何か* something
>questions: *何か* anything?
>negative statements: *何も + negative* not...anything

These two words are used in places where the particles は、が、and を are expected. 

Examples:
	*猫が何か持ってきました* The cat has brought something.
	*猫は何か食べましたか* Did the cat eat anything?
	*いいえ、猫は何も食べませんでした* No, the cat did not eat anything.

##### 表現ノート
- ***~する*** — Most irregular verbs are compounds of nouns and the verb する. If you have learned an irregular verb, therefore, you have also learned a noun. Some of these nouns can be used as the "object" of the verb する
	You can also do this:
	*日本語の勉強が好きです* I like studying Japanese

###### Culture Note
###### 日本の食べ物 [Foods in Japan]

A traditional Japanese meal consists of a bowl of white rice (ご飯), a couple of dishes (おかず), and soup (often みそしる), and is called 定食 (set menu). However, many Japanese don't eat traditional food or rice-based dishes for every meal.

*Hiragana* and *katakana* represent sounds. *Hiragana* is used for conjugation endings, function words, and native Japanese words not covered by kanji. *Katakana* is normally used for writing loanwords and foreign names. *Kanji*, or Chinese characters, represent not just sounds but also meanings. Mostly, they are used for nouns, stems of verbs, and adjectives. 

## Hiragana

There are 46 basic *hiragana* syllables.

#### Hiragana with Diacritical marks

ぢ (ji) and づ (zu) are pronounced the same as じ (ji) and ず (zu), respectively, and have limited use. 

#### Transcribing Contracted Sounds

Small や, ゆ and よ follow after letters in the second column and are used to transcribe contracted sounds. The contracted sound represents a single syllable.

#### Transcribing Double Consonants

There is another small letter, っ, which is used when transcribing double consonants such as *tt* and *pp*. 

Examples: 
		*かった* (won)
		*さっか* (writer)
		*はっぱ* (leaf)
		*ざっし* (magazine)

#### Long Vowels

When the same vowel is placed one right after the other, the pronuncation becomes about twice as long as the single vowel.

Examples:
		*おばあさん* (grandmother)
		*おじいさん* (grandfather)
		*すうじ* (number)

Sometimes, the long *ee* and *oo* sounds are replaced by え instead of い, and お instead of う due to historical reasons. 

#### Vowels to be Dropped

The vowels *i* and *u* are sometimes dropped when placed between voiceless consonants (k, s, t, p, and h), or at the end of an utterance preceded by voiceless consonants. 

Example:
		すきです s(*u*)kides(*u*) (*I like it.*)

## Katakana

ぢ (ji) and ヅ (zu) are pronounced the sama as ジ (ji) and ズ (zu), respectively, and have limited use.

#### Long Vowels

The long vowels are written with — . 

Examples:
		*カー* (car)
		*スキー* (ski)
		*スーツ* (suit)
		*ケーキ* (cake)
		*ボール* (ball)

Additional combinations with small vowel letters are used to transcribe foreign sounds which originally did not exist in Japanese. 

Examples:
		ウィ *ハロウィーン* ==harowiin== (halloween)
		ウェ *ハイウェイ* ==haiwee== (highway)
		ウォ *ミネラルウォーター* ==mineraruwootaa== (mineral water)
		シェ *シェフ* ==shefu== (chef) 
		ジェ *ジェームス*　==jeemusu== (James)
		チェ *チェック* ==chekku== (check)
		ファ *ファッション* ==fasshon== (fashion)
		フィ *フィリピン* ==firipin== (Philippine)
		フェ *カフェ* ==kafe== (cafe)
		フォ *フォーク* ==fooku== (fork)
		ティ *パーティー* ==paatii== (party)
		ディ *ディズニーランド* ==Dizuniirando== (Disneyland)
		デュ *デュエット* ==dyuetto== (duet)

## Kanji

*Kanji* are Chinese characters introduced to Japan more than 1,500 years ago when the Japanese did not have a writing system. *Hiragana* and *katakana* evolved from simplified Chinese characters. 

Kanji represents both meanings and sounds. Most kanji possess multiple readings, which are divided into two types: *on-yomi* (Chinese readings) and *kun-yomi* (Japanese readings). 

By the time of high school graduation, Japanese are expected to know 2,136 *kanji* (called *joyo kanji*).


Some kanji are made from pictures called ==pictograms==. Some are made of dots and lines to represent numbers or abstract concepts called ==ideograms==. Some kanji are made from the combination of two or more kanji called ==compound ideograms==. Some kanji are made up of a meaning element and a sound element called ==phonetic-ideographic characters==.

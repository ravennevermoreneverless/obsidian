## 文法

### 1. Xがあります/います

Xがあります means "there is/are X (nonliving thing)". The particle が introduces or presents the item X. You can use あります when you want to say that there is something at a certain location. 

あります is different from other verbs:
(1) It calls for the particle に, instead of で, for the place description.
(2) The place description usually comes at the beginning of the sentence. 
(3) The thing description is usually followed by the particle が, rather than は.

You can use あります to say that you *have* or *own something*. You can also use it to say that *an event will take place*. 

When you want to present a person or some other sentient being, rather than a thing, you need to use the verb います. You can also use います to say that you have friends, siblings, and so forth.

### 2. Describing Where Things Are

![[describing where things are (japanese).jpg]]

Example: 
	*銀行は図書館のとなりです* The bank is next to the library. 
	*かさはテーブルの下です* The umbrella is under the table.
	*レストランはデパートと病院の間です* The restaurant is between the department store and the hospital. 

You can use location words together with a verb to describe an event that occur in the place. You will need the particle で. 

Example: 
	*私はモスバーガーの前でメアリーさんを待ちました* I waited for Mary in front of the Mos Burger place. 
### 3. Past Tense of です

>past tense, affirmative : *~でした*
>past tense, negative : *~じゃなかったです*

### 4. Past Tense of Verbs

>past tense, affirmative : *~ました*
>past tense, negative : *~ませんでした*

### 5. も

You can also use も when two or more people perform the same activity. 

Example:
	*私はきのう京都に行きました* I went to Kyoto yesterday.
	*山下先生もきのう京都に行きました* Professor Yamashita went to Kyoto yesterday, too. 

Or when someone buys, sees, or eats two or more things. 

Example:
	*メアリーさんはくつを買いました* Mary bought shoes.
	*メアリーさんは鞄も買いました* Mary bought a bag, too. 

You can also use も when you go to two places, do something on two different occasions, and so forth. 

Example:
	*私は先週京都に行きました* I went to Kyoto last week.
	*大阪にも行きました* I went to Osaka, too. 

### 6. 一時間

The duration of an activity is expressed with a bare noun, like 一時間. Such a noun stands alone (not followed by any particle). 

For an approximate measurement, you can add ぐらい after ~時間. 

Example: 
	*私はきのう日本語を三時間ぐらい勉強しました* I studied Japanese for about three hours yesterday

To say one hour and a half, you can add 半 immediately after ~時間. 

### 7. たくさん

If you want to add a quantity word like たくさん to the direct object of a sentence, you can either place it before the noun, or after the particle を.

### 8. と

The particle と has two functions:
(1) To connect two nouns A and B.

Example:
	*日本語と英語を話します* I speak Japanese and English. 

(2) "together with"; it describes with whom you do something. 
	*メアリーさんはスーさんと韓国に行きます* Mary will go to Korea with Sue. 

##### 表現ノート
- ***Xの前*** — often used in the sense of "across (the street) from X" or "opposite X" or Xのむかい. If something is behind X, or farther away from a street and cannot be directly seen because of the intervening X, while Xの後ろ is correct, you can also say Xのうら.
- ***えっ/あっ*** — えっ is like the incredulous "what?" that you use when you have heard something that is hard to believe. あっ is used when you have suddenly noticed or remembered something. The small っ at the end of those little words indicates that these words, when pronounced, are very short.

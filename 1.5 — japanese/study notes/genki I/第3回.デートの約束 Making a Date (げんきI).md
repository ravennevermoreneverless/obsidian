## 文法

### 1. Verb Conjugation 

(1) the "dictionary forms"
(2) the present tense affirmative forms
(3) the present tense nevative forms

![[japanese verb conjugation 1.jpg]]

***る-verb*** — added the suffix る to the verb base to form the dictionary form
*る-verb long form* : simply add the suffixes ます and ません, instead of る, to the bases.

***う-verb*** — added the suffix う to the verb base to form the dictionary form
*う-verb long form* : base plus suffixes います and いません. You will find letters shifting in the same row of the hiragana chart. 

***verb stems*** — the word parts before the ます and ません

***irregular verbs***

These two verbs are also used to form compound verbs. 

- If you see the vowels あ, う, or お right before the final る, you can absolutely say they are う-verbs.
- If you see the vowels い and え before the final る, in most cases, the verbs are る-verbs.

### 2. Verb Types and the "Present Tense"

***action verbs*** — the "present tense" either means:
(1) a person habitually or regularly engages in these activities
(2) a person will, or is planning to, perform these activities in the future

### 3. Particles

***を*** — indicates "direct objects", the kind of things that are directly involved in, or affected by, the event. 

***で*** — indicates where the event described by the verb takes place

***に*** — (1) the goal toward which things move/goal of movement
	(2) the time at which an event takes place

***へ*** — indicates the goal of movement (it may replace に only in the goal-of-movement sense) 

### 4. Time Reference

You need particle に with:
(1) the days of the week like "on Sunday"
(2) numerical time expressions, like "at 10:45" and "in September"

You do not use the particle に with:
(1) time expressions defined relative to the present moment, such as "today" and "tomorrow"
(2) expressions describing regular intervals, such as "every day"
(3) the word for "when"

You normally do not use に with:
(1) the parts of a day, like "in the morning" and "at night"
(2) the word for "weekend" 
They depend on style, emphases, and personal preferences.

### 5. ~ませんか

Add ませんか to a sentence to extend an invitation.

==Note== : Its affirmative counterpart, ますか, cannot be used the same.

### 6. Word Order

Japanese sentences are fairly flexible in the arrangement of elements that appear in them.

Generally, sentences are made up of several noun-particle sequences followed by a verb or an adjective, which in turn is often followed by a sentence-final particle such as か, ね, or よ.

Among the noun-particle sequences, their relative orders are to a large extent free.

### 7. Frequency Adverbs

You can add a frequency adverb such as 毎日 (everyday), よく (often), and ときどき (sometimes) to a sentence to describe how often you do something. 

You can also add frequency adverbs like "ぜんぜん" (never; not at all) and あまり (not often; not very much) to describe how infrequent an activity or event is. If you use these, you need to conclude the sentence with ません. 

### 8. The Topic Particle は

The particle は puts forward the item that you want to talk about and comment on. 

A topic phrase doesn't need to be the subject of a sentence. Nonsubject phrases are made topics with the help of the particle は. 

##### 表現ノート

- ***行く/来る*** — 来る is the movement toward the place where the speaker is, while 行く is a movement in a direction away from the speaker
- ***ちょっと*** — this literally means "a little", "a bit", "a small amount". It is commonly used fot a polite refusal. In this case, it means "inconvenient", "impossible", and so on. Japanese people don't normally reject requests, suggestions, or invitations with いいえ because it sounds too direct. 

###### Culture Note
###### 日本の家 [Japanese Houses]

Traditionally, Japanese buildings were made of wood. Rooms were floored with たたみ (rice-straw mats) and divised by ふすま or しょうじ (two types of sliding doors). 

Modern Japanese houses have mainly Western-style rooms, and are equipped with Western-style toilets. However, most bathrooms retain traditional characteristics — they are separated from toilets and sinks, and have some space for washing one's body outside the bathtub.

Usually, all family members share the same bathtub water, so it is necessary to clean one's body before getting into the bathtub.

げんかん is another traditional feature of Japanese homes. It is the space inside the entrance where people remove their shoes.

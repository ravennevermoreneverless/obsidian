## 文法

### 1. Te-form

て-forms are used for:
- making requests ("...please.")
- giving and asking for permission ("You may.../May I...?")
- stating that something is forbidden ("You must not...")
- forming a sentence that describes two events or activities ("I did this and did that.")

### 2. ~てください

Use a verbal て-form together with ください to make a polite request to another person "please do...for me."

Example:
	*教科書を読んでください* Please read the textbook
	*すみません。ちょっと教えてください* Excuse me. Please teach me a little. (= Tell me. I need your advice.) 

### 3. ~てもいいです

A verbal て-form plus もいいです means "you may do..." which describes an activity that is permitted. To ask for permission, you can turn it into a question sentence, ~てもいいですか. To answer the question, you can just say いいです instead of もいいです. 

Example: 
	*教科書を見てもいいですか* May I see the textbook?
	*はい。見てもいいですよ* Yes, you may.
	*いいですよ* You may.
	*どうぞ* Please. 

### 4. ~てはいけません

A verbal て-form plus はいけません means "you must not do...", a strong prohibition statement, as in rules and regulations.

Example: 
	*ここで写真を撮ってはいけません* You must not take pictures here. 

### 5. Describing Two Activities

You can use a て-form if you want to combine two or more verbs, as in describing a sequence of events or actions ("I did this and then I did that"). The て-form does the work of "and" with verbs. The tense of the verb at the end of each sentence determines when these events take place. 

Examples:
	*ノートえお借りて、コピーします* I will borrow her notebook and photocopy it. 
	*今日は、6時に起きて、勉強しました* Today I got up at six and studied.
	*食堂は行って、昼ご飯を食べましょう* Let's go to the cafeteria and have lunch. 

The て-form of a verb can also be used to connect a verb more "loosely" with the rest of a sentence. 

Examples: 
	*バスに乗って、会社に行きます* I go to work by bus. (I take a bus to work.)
	*教科書を忘れて、すみません* I am sorry for not bringing in the textbook. (I left the book at home, and I am sorry.)

### ~から

A sentence that ends with から (because) explains the reason or the cause of a situation, a proposal, and so forth. 

>(situation)。(explanation) *から*。

Examples: 
	*私は今晩勉強しょます。あしたテストがありますから* I will study this evening. (Because) we will have an exam tomorrow.
	*バスに乗りましょう。タクシーは高いですから* Let's go by bus. (Because) taxis are expensive. 

### 7. ~ましょうか

ましょうか is also used in the sense of "let me do..." in offering assistance. If you see somebody having a hard time opening the lid of a bottle, for example, you can offer help by saying:
	*(私が)やりましょうか* I'll do it. 
Or to a person who is carrying a heavy bag:
	*荷物を持ちましょうか* Shall I carry your bag?

##### 表現ノート
- ***遅く/遅い*** — 遅い is an adjective which modifies nouns or works as a predicate, 遅く is an adverb and modifies verbs. 
	Examples:
		A: *きのう一時に寝ました* I went to bed at one o'clock yesterday.
		B: *遅いですね* It's late.
		*週末には、10時ごろ起きて、遅い朝ご飯を食べます* On weekends, I get up around 10:00 and eat late breakfast.
		*きのう、遅く寝ました* I went to bed late yesterday. 
==Note:== You can also apply this rule to 早い/早く
- ***どうも*** — normally used with ありがとう, as in どうもありがとう (Thank you very much), or with すみません, as in どうもすみません (I am very sorry/Thank you very much). When used alone, it is an abbreviation of those. どうも functions in many ways, depending on the situation. Some people use どうも as "hello" or "good-bye." 
- ***お*** — Many words that begins with お can also be used without it. お in such words simply adds smoothness and nuance of social refinement, without changing the meaning of words.

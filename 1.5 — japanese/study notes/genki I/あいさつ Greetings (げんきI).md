- ***さようなら*** — this indicates that the person saying goodbye does not expect to see the person spoken to before "she turns a page in her life", not until a new day arrives or until fate brings the two together again. (Its daily use is largely restricted to school children taking leave of their teachers).

###### Culture Note
###### あいさつとおじぎ [Greetings and Bowing]

Japanese people greet each other by bowing, which has many functions, such as expressing respect, gratitude, or apologies. Generally, the longer and deeper you bow, the more formal and respectful it appears to others. 

Many Japanese people tend to feel uncomfortable with physical contact, but handshaking is becoming common in the business world, especially relating to foreigners.

When meeting someone for the first time in a business situation, it is customary to exchange *meeshi* (business cards) with a small bow.

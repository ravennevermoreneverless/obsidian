## 文法

### 1. Comparison between Two Items

The idea of comparison is expressed by adding something to the nouns that are compared.
>*A==のほうが== B**より** (property)* = A is ==more== (property) **than** B.

You can ask for another person's opinion on two things in comparative terms. 
>*AとBと どちらのほう/どっちのほうが (property)* = Between A and B, which is more (property)?

Example: 
	*バスト電車とどっちのほうが安いですか* Which is cheaper, (going by) bus or (by) train? 

### 2. Comparison among Three or More Items

In comparison among three or more items, the degree qualifier いちばん is used.
>*[(class of items) ==の中で==] Aが**いちばん** (property)* = A is **the most** (property) [==among== (a class of items)].

Example:
	Q: *ロシアとフランスと日本の中で、どこからいちばんさむいですか* Between Russia, France, and Japan, which country has the coldest climate? 
	A: *ロシアがいちばん寒いと思います* Russia is the coldest, I think. 
	Q: *季節の中でいつがいちばん好きですか* What season do you like best? 
	A: *秋がいちばん好きです* I like fall the most. 

==Note :== Words like のほう and どっち aren't used in these statements comparing 3 or more items. Insteas, normal question words like だれ, どれ, 何, いつ, and どこ are used. 

### 3. adjective/noun + の

When a noun follows an adjective, and when it is clear what you are referring to, you can replace the noun with the pronoun の, "one". You can use の to avoid repetition. 

Examples: 
	*私は黒いセーターを持っています。赤いのも持っています* I have a black sweater. I have a red one, too. 
	*安い辞書を買いに行きました。でもいいのがありませんでした* I went to buy an inexpensive dictionary, but there were no good ones.

Similarly, a noun following another noun can be reduced. Here, a sequence of the form "nounのnoun" will be reduced to "nounの". You simply omit the second noun. 
	Q: *これはスーさんのかばんですか* Is this Sue's bag?
	A: *いいえ、それはメアリーさんのです* No, that is Mary's. 
	*アメリカのアイスクリームのほうが日本のよりおいしいです* American ice cream is more delicious than Japanese one. 

### 4. ~つもりだ

Verbs in the present tense short forms plus つもりだ describes what a person is planning to do in the future. You can also use a verb in the negative plus つもり to say what you are planning not to do, or what you do not intend to do.
>*verb (present, short) + つもりだ* (I) intend to do...

Examples:
	*(私は)週末にたけしさんとテニスをするつもりです* I intend to play tennis with Takeshi this weekend. 
	*山下先生はあした大学に来ないつもりです* Professor Yamashita does not intend to come to school tomorrow. 
	*お寺を見に行くつもりでしたが、天気がよくなかったから、いきませんでした* We were planning to visit a temple, but we didn't, because the weather was not good. 
### 5. adjective + なる

The verb なる means "to become", indicatinga change. なる follows nouns and both types of adjectives. 
- い-adjectives : *あたたかい* => *あたたかくなる* to become warm/warmer 
- な-adjectives : *静か(な)* => *静かになる* to become quiet/quieter 
- nouns : *会社員* => *会社員になる* to become a company employee

Examples: 
	*日本語の勉強が楽しくなりました* Studying the Japanese language is fun now (though it was like torture before). 
	*日本語の勉強が好きになりました* I have grown fond of studying the Japanese language. 

Sometimes it will get confusing when you use the なる for adjectives, raising the question of absolute change ("it has become warm, hence it is not cold any longer") or a relative change ("it has become warmer, but it is still cold"), that's why なる sentences are ambiguous in nature. If you want to make it clear that you are talking in relative terms, you can use the comparison together with なる.

Example: 
	*メアリーさんは前より日本語が上手になりました* Mary has become better in Japanese than before. 
### 6. どこかに/どこにも

something : 何か__
someone : だれか__
somewhere : どこか__

not anything : 何__も
not anyone : だれ__も
not anywhere : どこ__も

The particles に, へ, and で are inserted in the underscores above. 

Examples: 
	Q: *どこかへ行きましたか* Did you go anywhere?
	A: *いいえ、どこへも行きませんでした* No, I didn't go anywhere
	Q: *だれかに会いましたか* Did you see anybody?
	A: *いいえ、だれにも会いませんでした* No, I didn't see anybody. 
	Q: *何かしましたか* Did you do anything?
	A: *いいえ、何もしませんでした* No, I didn't do anything. 

### 7. で

You can use the particle で with nouns that describe the means of transportation and the instruments you use.

Examples: 
	*はしでご飯を食べます* We eat our meals with chopsticks.
	*日本語で話しましょう* Let's talk in Japanese.
	*バスで駅まで行きました* I went to the station by bus.
	*テレビで映画を見ました* I saw a movie on TV. 

##### 表現ノート
- ***午前と午後の便がありますが...*** — We sometimes use が and けど (but) at the end of a sentence when we want our partners to treat what we have just said as a given, common ground to build upon. These words often indicate the speaker's intention to give her partner a chance to react and speak up. This also contributes to the politeness of one's utterance. 
###### Culture Note
###### 日本の交通機関 [Public Transportation in Japan]

Japan's public transportation system is highly advanced, and the most common forms are trains, buses, and subways. The Japan Railways Group (JR Group) has trains covering almost all areas of the country. 

If you are in Japan on a "Temporary Visitor" entry permit and want to travel to different regions, consider getting a **Japan Rail Pass**, which offers unlimited travel on almost all JR lines (including bullet trains, except Nozomi) for a certain number of days. 

If you are planning a budget trip, try the **Seishun 18 Kippu**. This seasonal discount gives you five days of unlimited rides on local and rapid-service JR trains for only 11,500 yen. 

**Highway buses** are also a good way to travel between major cities. These usually take longer hours but they cost less. Also, if you travel on an overnight bus, you can save on accommodation costs.

## 文法

### 1. ~んです

There are two ways to make a statement. One is simply stating a fact, the other is explaining something in context. 

An explanation has two components, one thag is explicitly described in the sentence, and another, which implied or explained, by it. The sentence-final expression んです serves as the link between what the sentence says and what it accounts for.

Examples:
	*あしたテストがあります* I have an exam tomorrow. (a simple observation). 
	*あしたテストがあるんです* I have an exam tomorrow (So I can't go out tonight). 
	*トイレに行きたいです* I want to go to the bathroom. (declaration of one' wish)
	*トイレに行きたいんです* (So tell me where it is). 

んです goes after the short form of a predicate. The predicate can either be in the affirmative or
negative, either in the present tense or past tense. んです does not usually appear in the negative or past tense forms. In writing, it is more common to find のです instead of んです. 

Example:
	*成績がよくないんです* ==(in response to the question "Why do you look so upset?")== (As a matter of fact) My grade is not good.
	*試験が終わったんです* ==(explaining to a person who has caught you smiling)== The exam is over. (That's why I'm smiling.)

When it follows a noun or a な-adjective, な comes in between.

You can use んです in questions to invite further clarifications from the person you are talking to. It is very often used together with question words, such as どうして (why) and どうした (what has happened).

Examples:
	Q: *どうして彼と別れたんですか* Why did you break up with your boyfriend? (You've got to tell me.)
	A: *彼、ぜんぜんお風呂に入らないんです* Oh, him. He never takes a bath. (That's a good enough reason, isn't it?)
	Q: *どうしたんですか* What happened? (You look shattered.)
	A: *猫が死んだんです* My cat died. (That should explain how I look today.) 

You can also use んです to provide an additional comment on what has just been said.

Example:
	A: *とてもいい教科書ですね* That's a great textbook that you are using.
	B : *ええ。私の大学の先生が書いたんです* You bet. The professors at my university wrote it (for your information). 

### ~すぎる

Verb stems may be followed by the helping verb すぎる, which means "too much" or "to excess". It conjugates as a regular る-verb. 

Examples:
	*早く起きすぎました* I got up too early.
	*食べすぎてはいけません* You must not eat too much.

すぎる can also follow adjective bases, you just drop the い and な at the end of the adjectives then add すぎる.

You use すぎる when something is beyond normal or proper, suggesting that you do not welcome it. Thus 親切すぎます for example is not a straightforward compliment. Use とても and すごく if you simply want to say something is in a high degree. 

### 3. ~ほうがいいです

ほうがいいです "it is better (for you) to do..." is a sentence-final expression which you can use to give advice. When you suggest an activity with ほうがいいです, you are giving a very specific piece of advice, namely, that it is advisable to do it, and if one does not follow then advice, there is a danger or a problem. 

ほうがいいです depends on the tense forms. If the advice is in the affirmative, it generally follows the past tense of a verb. When the advice is in the negative, the verb is in the present tense short form. 

Examples:
	*もっと野菜を食べたほうがいいですよ* You'd better eat more vegetables.
	*授業を休まないほうがいいですよ* It is betger not to skip classes. 

### 4. ~ので

ので is just like から. Stylistically, ので sounds slightly more formal than から.
>*(reason)ので (situation).* (situation), because (reason). 

Examples:
	*いつも日本語で話すので、日本語が上手になりました* My Japanese has improved, because I always speak Japanese.
	*宿題がたくさんあったので、昨日の夜、寝ませんでした* I did not sleep last night, because I had a lot of homework. 

The reason part of a sentence ends in a short form predicate. When ので follows a な-adjective or a noun, な comes in between.

Examples:
	*その人はいじわるなので、きらいです* I do not like that person, because he is mean. 
	*今日は日曜日なので、銀行は休みです* Banks are closed, because today is a Sunday.

### 5. ~なければいけません/~なきゃいけません

We use なければいけません and なきゃいけません to say that it is necessary to do something, or "must". The なきゃ is very colloquial and is mainly found in the spoken language, while the more formal なければ variant is often seen in the written language.

Example:
	*試験があるから、勉強しなければいけません/なきゃいけません* I have to study, because there will be an exam. 

なければ and なきゃ mean "if you do not do.." and いけません roughly means "you can not go"; なければいけません and なきゃいけません therefore literally means "you cannot go not doing" with double negative resulting in an affirmative statement. な in なければ and なきゃ comes from the negative ない. Just drop the last い and replace it with ければ　or きゃ.

You can change いけません to いけませんでした to say you had to, and to なきゃいけない in casual speech, and to なければいけない in the written language.

Examples:
	*けさは、6時に起きなきゃいけませんでした* I had to get up at 6 this morning.
	*毎日、練習しなきゃいけないんです* (The truth is) I must practice everyday. 

### 6. ~でしょう

We use the sentence-final expression でしょう (probably) when we are making a guess or a prediction. でしょう follows verbs and い-adjectives in short forms, in the affirmative and in the negative. 

でしょう can be turned into questions (~でしょうか) which can be used to invite another person's opinion or guess.

Example:
	*日本語と韓国語と、どっちのほうが難しいでしょうか* Which would you say is more difficult, Japanese or Korean? 

The short form of でしょう is だろう. You can use it to cautiously phrase a prediction or an analysis. 

Example:
	*たけしさんは興味があるだろうと思います* I think Takeshi would be interested in it. 

In casual exchanges, you can use でしょう with the question intonation, and most often pronounced shorter でしょ if you want to check if your partner agrees that you have correct understanding about what you have just said.

Examples:
	*ジョン、中国語がわかるでしょ？これ、読んで* John, you understand Chinese, right? Can you read this for me?

###### Culture Note
###### 日本の気候 [The Japanese Climate]

![[japan climate.jpg]]

==Winter== : sunny and dry on the Pacific coast, cloudy and snowy on the Sea of Japan coast
==Spring== : rather short because daily temperatures rise quickly and the season is cut short by the arrival of the rainy season (梅雨) which lasts for about a month and a half.
==Summer== : hot and very humid, almost tropical in some places. Typhoons make occasional landfalls in summer and early fall. 

Temperature, including body temperature, is measured in Celsius.

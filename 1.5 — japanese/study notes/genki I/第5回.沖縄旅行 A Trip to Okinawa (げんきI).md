## 文法

### 1. Adjectives 

Japanese adjectives conjugate for tense (present and past), polarity (affirmative and negative) and so forth, just like verbs. 

There are two types of adjectives: 

***い-adjectives***
>present, affirmative : *さむいです* It is cold.
>present, negative : *さむくないです/さむくありません* It is not cold.
>past, affirmative : *さむかったです* It was cold. 
>past, negative : *さむくなかったです/さむくありませんでした* It was not cold

**いい(irregular)**
>present, affirmative : *いいです* 
>present, negative : *よくないです/よくありません*
>past, affirmative : *よかったです*
>past, negative : *よくなかったです/よくありませんでした*

Compound adjectives like かっこいい that are built with いい follow this syllable change. 

***な-adjectives*** 
>present, affirmative : *元気です* She is healthy.
>present, negative : *元気じゃないです/元気じゃありません* She is not healthy.
>past. affirmative : *元気でした* She was healthy. 
>past, negative : *元気じゃなかったです/元気じゃありませんでした* She was not healthy.

The final syllable な is dropped in these long forms of な-adjectives. You can also substitute では for じゃ as in ではありません and ではありませんでした which are more often used in the written language than in the spoken language. 

If you want to say things like "very hot" and "a little hot" you can add "degree adverbs" like すごく (extremely), とても (very) and ちょっと (a little; slightly) before adjectives. 

Example:
	*沖縄の海はとてもきれいでした* The sea was very beautiful in Okinawa. 
	*この部屋はちょっと暑いです* This room is a little hot. 

### 2. 好き(な)/きらい(な)

Example: 
	*ロバートさんは日本語のクラスが好きです* Robert likes his Japanese classes. 
	*山下先生は魚がきらいです* Professor Yamashita dislikes fish. 

The item that is liked or disliked can also be a person. Be careful using these words in reference to your preference for a specific person. However, because 好きです is usually taken to be an admission of one's romantic interest. 

You can use the intensified forms of these two, namely, 大好きです (like very much) and 大嫌いです (hate), which are more often used than the degree modifier とても in combination of 好きです and きらいです.

When Japanese people want to say that they neither like or dislike something, they usually say: 
>*好きでもきらいでもないです* I neither like nor dislike (it). 

You can also use 好きな and きらいな as modifiers of nouns.

Example:
	*これは私の好きな本です* This is my favorite book. 

### 3. ~ましょう/~ましょうか

Take a long form of a verb and replace the ending with ましょう or ましょうか and you will get the Japanese expression for "let's..." which you can use to suggest a olan of action.

Examples: 
	*一緒に図書館で勉強しましょう* Let's study in the library together. 
	*喫茶店でコーヒーを飲みましょうか* Shall we drink coffee at a coffee shop?

### 4. Counting

1. We use different number words for different kinds of items; the words used for counting people are different from the words used for counting books
2. Number words often come after, rather than before, the items counted in a sentence.

Example:
	*リーさんh切手を三枚買いました* Lee bought three stamps. 

##### 表現ノート
- ***忙しい/にぎやか(な)*** — 忙しい is used when we describe people and is not used for places. When you want to say that Tokyo is busy, you should use にぎやか(な).
==Note :== The sentence below is also acceptable, since the subject "I" is omitte in the sentence. 

Example: 
	*日曜日は忙しいです* => *日曜日は(私は)忙しいです*
	I am busy on Sunday.

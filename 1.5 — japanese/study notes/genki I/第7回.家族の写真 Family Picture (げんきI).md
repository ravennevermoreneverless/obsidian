## 文法

### 1. ~ている

A verbal "て-form" when followed by the helping verb いる, means either of the following:
(1) an action in progress, or
(2) a past event that is connected with the present

So far, we have learned that verbs can be roughly divided into 3 groups based on their semantics:
- verbs that describe continuous states
- verbs that describe activities that last for some time
- verbs thay describe changes that are more or less instantenous

You can also a ~ています sentence to describe what a person does by occupation or by habit, aside from describing what you are doing at this moment. 

Example: 
	*私は英語を教えています* I teach English. / I am teaching English (right now). 

Verbs from the third group changes from one state to another. ている indicates a past occurence of a chage which has retained its significance until the present moment. In other words, ている describes the **result of a change**. 

Examples:
	*山下先生は結婚しています* Professor Yamashita is married. 
	*みちこさんは窓の近くに座っています* Michiko is seated near the window.

Here are some more examples of verbs that are commonly used in the ~ている framework.
	持つ => 持っている (has) => *スーさんはお金をたくさん持っています* Sue has a lot of money. 
	知る => 知っている (knows) => *山下先生じゃ母を知っています* Professor Yamashita knows my mother. 
	太る => 太っている (is overweight) => *トムさんはちょっと太っています* Tom is a little overweight. 
	やせる => やせている (is thin) => *私の弟はとてもやせています* My younger brother is very thin. 
	着る => 着ている (wears) => *メアリーさんはTシャツを着ています* Mary is wearing/wears a T-shirt. 
	起きる => 起きている (is awake) => *お父さんは起きています* Dad is up and awake. 
	住む => 住んでいる (lives in) => *家族は東京に住んでいます* My family lives in Tokyo. 
	勤める => 勤めている (works for) => *私の姉は日本の会社に勤めている* My older sister works for a Japanese company. 

==Note :== Verbs like 行く and 来る belong to this group. Thus 行っている and 来ている indicate the current states that result from prior movements, not movements that are currently in progress.

Examples: 
	*中国に行っています* Somebody has gone to/is in China. 
	*うちに来ています* Somebody has come over to visit. 

The helping verb いる conjugates as a る-verb. 

### 2. メアリーさんは髪が長います

To describe somebody who has long hair, one could say: 
	*トムさんの髪は長いです* Tom's hair is long. 
But in fact it would be far more natural in Japanese to say:
	*トムさんは髪が長いです* Tom has long hair. (=As for Tom, he has long hair.) 

This rule applies to any description of a person's physical attributes in general. 

>*Aさん は body part が adjective* Person A has a body part which is... 

### 3. て-forms for Joining Sentences

The て-form of an い-adjective is formed by substituting くて for fhe final い. The て-form of a な-adjective and a noun + です sequence is formed by adding で to the base or the noun.

Examples:
	*あの店の食べ物は安くて、美味しいです* The food at that restaurant is inexpensive and delicious.
	*ホテルはきれいで、よかったです* The hotel was clean and we were happy.
	*山下先生じゃ日本人で、50歳ぐらいです* Professor Yamashita is a Japanese and he is about fifty years old. 

### 4. verb stem + に行く

If a person moves to another place in order to do something, we can describe their movement and its purpose this way:

The purpose of movement is a phrase consisting of a verb, its object, and so forth. Verbs describing the purpose of a movement must be in their stem forms. Stems are the part you get by removing ます from the verbs' present tense long forms. 

Examples:
	*デパートにかばんを買いに行きました* I went to a department store to buy a bag.
	*メアリーさんば日本に日本語を勉強しに来ました* Mary has come to Japan to study Japanese. 

### 5. Counting People

The "counter" for people is 人(にん) but "one person" and "two people" are irregular 一人(ひとり) and 二人(ふたり). 

To count people in a class, for example, you can add ~人 after the noun and the particle が and say:
>personが X人 います

Example:
	*私のクラスに(は)スウェーデン人の学生が一人います* There is one Swedish student in our class. 

The place expressions are often followed by には instead of に in this type of sentence. 

##### 表現ノート
- ***遊ぶ*** — means "to play", "to spend time pleasantly", or "to pay a social call"
	Examples:
		*子供の時、よく友達と遊びました* When I was a child, I often played with friends.
		*先週の週末じゃ東京に遊びに行きました* I went to Tokyo to have fun last weekend.
		*私のうちに遊びに来てください* Please come and see us. 
	==Note :== "to play" requires different words.
		Sports : to play tennis *テニスする*
		Games : to play games *ゲームをする*
		      to play cards *トランプをする*
		Music instruments : to play the guitar *ギターを弾く*
- ***知る/わかる*** — If you don't know the answer to a question but should have thought about it, you should say わかりません insteas of 知りません because in such context, 知りません would sound rude, implying that your ignorance on that matter is none of the inquirer's business.

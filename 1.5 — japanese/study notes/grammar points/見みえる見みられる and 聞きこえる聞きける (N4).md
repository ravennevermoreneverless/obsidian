### ノート

見みえる is different from 見みられる, the regular potential form of 見みる. 見みえる means "something or someone is spontaneously visible"; 見みられる, on the other hand, means that the subject of the sentence can see something or someone actively rather than passively.

The difference between 聞きこえる and 聞きける is the same. 聞きこえる means "something is spontaneously audible." On the other hand, 聞きける, the potential form of 聞きく, means that the subject of the sentence can hear the sound actively.

たらどうですか (lit. "How would you feel if you do something?") after a verb conveys advice or recommendation. The initial た in たらどうですか comes from the same ending as in the past tense short form of a verb in the affirmative. In casual speech, たらどうですか may be shortened to たらどう or たら.

たらどうですか may sometimes have a disapproving tone, expressing criticism of the person for not having performed the action already. It is, therefore, safer to avoid using it unless you were asked for advice.

Also, the pattern is not to be used for extending invitations. If, for example, you want to tell your friend to come visit, you do not want to use たらどうですか, but should instead use ませんか.

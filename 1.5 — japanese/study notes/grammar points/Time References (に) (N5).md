### ノート

The particle に is used with (1) the days of the week like "on Sunday," and (2) numerical time expressions, like "at 10:45," and "in September."

に is not used with (1) time expressions defined relative to the present moment, such as "today" and "tomorrow," (2) expressions describing regular intervals, such as "every day," and (3) the word for "when."

に is normally not used with (1) the parts of a day, like "in the morning" and "at night," and (2) the word for "weekend," but they can be followed by に, depending on styles, emphases, and personal preferences.

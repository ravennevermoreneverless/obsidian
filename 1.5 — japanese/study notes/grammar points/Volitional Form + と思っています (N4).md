### ノート

You can also use the volitional + と思おもいます, which suggests that the decision to perform the activity is being made on the spot at the time of speaking. と思おもっています, in contrast, tends to suggest that you have already decided to do something.

Note that verbs in volitional forms and verbs in the present tense convey different ideas when they are used with と思おもいます or と思おもっています. When you use volitionals, you are talking about your intention. When you use the present tense, you are talking about your prediction.

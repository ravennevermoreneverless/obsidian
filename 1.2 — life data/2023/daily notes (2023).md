## January

==2 - 1:39== My family went to Marikina yesterday and I specifically insisted to stay at home. I didn't sleep. I proceeded to journal, read, and watch films at home. It was a good decision. I slept around 7 PM but I couldn't remember ever opening the locked door for my family when they got home.

==2 - 17:13== Oh fuck, I fucked up my sleeping schedule and it's January. I don't know what to do. Should I go study? I didn't workout today. Should I sleep later or nah? I think I'll go study. I'm not gonna sleep to catch up. I need coffee. I also have to go journal.

==2 -23:50== I just finished watching a Korean film called ***Burning***. It was okay. I still can't find it in me to start studying. I have to like it again.

==3 - 23:09== I still didn't study today. Tomorrow shall be different.

==6 - 23:43== I only started studying earlier today. I did a total of 6 hours studying—better than none, am I right? I also practiced a little bit of *Kanji* first. I woke up around 12 PM. I didn't get a lot to do on my free time.

==8 - 00:10== I woke up around 6 PM because I slept in. I didn't do jack shit the entire day but be hyper active. My period is coming soon so I don't think I'll be working out soon. I'm gonna study a little bit later after I finish this movie I'm watching (***Wolf Children***).

==8 - 18:24== I couldn't focus at all today — so I just put off studying and instead used the laptop (my brother's not home). I made a study schedule until May. Also, I gained a study buddy on Discord — an Indian kid who's really talkative. I'll use this opportunity to better my communication skills. He seems nice anyways. I just duplicated 8 playlists and listened to a total of 2 albums. I decided to just listen to my RYM list in order. I like it that way. Oh, I also drew and journaled earlier. I did quite a lot, to say so myself. Also, I let my sister read my ***her pt.3*** poem, she found it amazing. Lastly, I studied Japanese and some *kanji*.

==9 - 23:43== I woke up around 12 PM today and almost forgot that I have a study buddy now so I have to be responsible for my time. Well, so, I ate and studied until 12 AM, nothing much. I didn't complete my pomodoros because I kinda napped in the afternoon and I didn't workout because I'm in my period. I'll workout after my period, I promise.

==10 - 23:42== I woke up 8 PM completely disregarding the fact that I have a study buddy now. I only studied for like 3 hours. I dreamt of Michaela again, and zombies.

==11 - 15:23== I did a lot today except for study. I couldn't scan my documents either. I also unwillingly accepted a request for help which requires commitment and consistency. I'm at a stand still and I'm bored. I planned my weekly schedule because my life seem too chaotic without it.

==12 - 22:20== I barely learned programming or code today. I just mostly listened to music and duplicated playlists. I woke up at 2 AM though so I had extra time to watch films in the morning. I wrote on my journal and drew a bit. I'm frustrated that I can't really draw well. I'm also thinking of taking Multimedia Arts in college if I can't get in to Computer Science. Whatever happens. I'll workout tomorrow, I'm getting fatter.

==14 - 00:42== I didn't do shit yesterday, I just slept. I lied to my study buddy.

==14 - 17:20== I didn't study nor workout today. Also, I ghosted my study buddy by deleting my Discord account. I made a playlist about CJ.

==15 - 22:39== It's Sunday but I still didn't do much of anything. In fact, I slept during late morning until afternoon so I still have energy left to do stuff. I watched 2 films today and created one artwork, I think that's productive enough. Tomorrow is Monday again, I really have to do some studying and workout—with a study buddy or none.

==16 - 22:34== I watched three ***Wrong Turn*** films today. I also studied a little bit of Algebra and a lot of Japanese. I worked out for a really short while, too, but I immediately got dizzy as fuck. I drew, too.

==17 - 22:29== I slept for 19 hours. Holy fucking shit.

==18 - 16:30== I studied Japanese today. I also worked out—but not completely. I didn't study today, goddamn didn't feel like it. I'll fix my study schedule tomorrow. I'll just watch films. I also read a book and took a morning walk with my sister.

==19 - 23:25== I studied a little bit of Javascript. I listened to albums and duplicated playlists. I finish***ed watching Fan Girl***. I also finally did the storyboard for ***her pt. 3*** but that's to be continued. My back is fucked, need to work out tomorrow.

==20 - 23:50== I slept from 3 AM to 8:30 PM—basically all day. I done nothing.

==21 - 16:41== I tried to study physics but I'm stuck, my brain's not working, I'll have to try again tomorrow. I finally completed one full workout routine. I couldn't watch more than one episode of ***Evangelion***, I'd also have to put that off until tomorrow. Tomorrow is another busy day.

==22 - 20:27== I woke up around past 2 AM and I got to watch a few short films. I made the continuation storyboard for ***her pt.3*** and studied Japanese. I finally finished Algebra 1: Functions but I decided to start Chemistry instead of Physics. I did a full workout and decided to do intermittent fasting starting today. The rest of the day I stalked my archive account. Also, I followed Renson back on all social media platforms.

==24 - 2:19== I studied Japanese a little bit. I listened to music and watched one episode of ***Evangelion***. Then, I watched a film. I felt sleepy so I slept. Supposedly it's just a nap but I woke up 11 hours later. I couldn't study.

==24 - 20:51== Oh my fucking god, chemistry is difficult. I may need more time for studying because I've got a lot on my plate for the week. Tomorrow I'll do the CET simulation to know the coverage. Today, I spent the entire day on Discord, in the SINEGANG server—I didn't talk a lot but I liked getting involved somehow. Tomorrow would be better. I think I'll just watch 2 films to decompress—I was almost losing my mind calculating atomic masses of compounds.

==26 - 6:06== I filled one page of my sketchbook, I literally can't draw. But I guess it'll get easier. I read ***The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*** then studied *kanji*. I felt a little sluggish so I decided to take a nap but I woke up the next day. I didn't get to do the CET simulation. Oh, also I didn't workout.

==26 - 21:04== I did some coding challenges on *CodeWars*—I ranked up to 7 *kyu* from 8 *kyu*. I still can't, for the life of me, go through the loops/arrays challenges on The Odin Project. I listened to 8 albums and duplicated 20+ playlists. All the while being on the SINEGANG Discord server.

==27 - 22:10== I got a disappointingly low score on the UPCAT reviewer. Either I'm gonna fail or I'll try harder to study. I thought I did well in math and science but I still got a low score. I think I'm a bit addicted to Bondee, kind of like a social media app but more intimate.

==28 - 23:04== I had a dream about CJ so naturally my day's automatically worse. My brain worked for a little bit at night though.

==29 - 21:28== I fell asleep watching ***964 Pinocchio*** last night. I woke up late today, around 1:30 PM. I had a weird dream that bothered me the entire day. I draw some frames in the storyboard for ***her pt. 3*** animation. I didn't study though. I just listened to music at night. I also didn't workout like I intended.

==31 - 1:20== I still feel sad... I cried last night. I miss my friends.

## February

==1 - 00:47== Fuck, I did nothing all day yesterday except be sad. I still miss my friends, I'm still sad about it that I'm physically unable to study or do anything. I'm glad my brother didn't use the laptop. I used my time to duplicate playlists and listen to music. Oh, and I'm reading past conversations with my internet friends. Just realized I spoke with CJ a lot. I'm also realizing I kinda don't have much character development. And I have a lot of issues (nothing new). My back is fucking killing me right now.

==2 - 00:10== I'm still so fucking sad, hyper aware that I don't like myself. I slept for only 5 hours then my mom and I went to *Angono, Riza*l to try and find apartments/houses for rent. It was so fucking tiring. It was scorching hot outside, I had a headache. And my back and legs were fucking killing me. I was so grateful when we got home but I felt like shit. Not sure if it was because I didn't get enough sleep, barely ate anything (I feel nauseous when I see food), the exhausting commute, or the stress and sadness I feel. I still couldn't do anything significant. I need to take a breath.

==3 - 23:39== I finished an entire book, ***Living with limerence: A guide for the smitten*** written by *Dr. L*, all in one sitting, and I think I just reached an emotional breakthrough. It is exactly what I need for years. Now I know what the fuck is wrong with me and what to do about it now. It's time to change.

==6 - 00:00== A lot has happened. I met up with my friends last Saturday—we drank, ate, sang and talked. It was so much fun, I missed being with them. I also went back to Instagram, but only with my dump account where I follow my friends (not my family). CJ, Louise, and MJ still follow me there—a part of me is afraid they will unfollow once they realize I'm active again. But anyways, that shouldn't matter. The only thing that has to matter is to improve my self-esteem and get over my limerence, so I can be friends with them again.

==7 - 00:03== We went to NCMH today (yesterday). I was mostly alone, I went to the psychiatrist and got my meds, alone. I can be independent now. Also, I started taking therapy using the book I got online. I'm gonna try my best to change.

==7 - 23:36== I met up with IC today for coffee at Tim Hortons—I treated her. It was fun. When I went home, I walked from Capitol Commons to our house. I ate pizza supreme *kariman* and drank some drinks on the way. I feel accomplished, for some reason. I posted on my instagram story, CJ saw it. I also saw her instagram story. I clicked on it, because I was curious. I still think she's pretty, and that's upsetting. I viewed it multiple times, I want to say I hate myself for that but no, I'll do better next time. I won't view her stories anymore. Not until I can feel for her what I feel now for Naomi: neutrality, genuine friendship. I hope she doesn't view my stories in return.

==8 - 23:53== I woke up really late, around 6 in the early evening. I didn't got to do much but do a therapy session and listen to music.

==9 - 23:21== This day, I have successfully completed duplicating all my Spotify playlists on GDocs. I also listened to a couple of albums, and did one therapy session. It's an uneventful yet good day.

==10 - 23:20== Fucking woke up past 6 PM, didnt do anything but 2 therapy sessions.

==11 - 21:00== I haven't slept yet since yesterday, I'm running on excessive coffee. I managed to study for a little bit, draw, watch films, watch Evangelion, and finish the therapy book. Jhanna finally replied to me on TG. I also decided to continue the animation project about CJ, but instead of the "lost love/the one that got away" theme, I'm going with the "limerence" theme—I modified the ending to better suit my current feelings. Again, I couldn't control my impulse to check CJ's instagram stories. It's okay, next time I'll try even harder. I won't open that account unless I have something to post.

==13 - 00:37== I woke up late again LOL, but I still tried to study as much as I can.

==13 - 22:33== I fell asleep around past 12 NN when I stopped studying.

==15 - 6:44== I'm currently listening to music as we speak, using my brother's laptop. Today's not laptop day but I snatched the laptop either way. I forgot to log here for the 14th so I'll write it down now.

==15 - 23:39== I don't even remember what happened today.

==16 - 23:53== I did nothing all day but listen to music and have my back hurt for sitting too long. I also didn't feel well earlier, probably because I was hungry and sleep-deprived.

==17 - 23:23== I woke up at 12 midnight and proceeded to study immediately. I stopped in the middle because I thought I have too much time so I took a nap. But then I slept for more than 12 hours haha. Fuck me.

==18 - 21:46== I watched 4 fucked up films today. And in the middle of studying in the morning, I was informed that we're going to Marikina, in my dad's car. It was fun, we ate and sang. I posted on my Instagram story and CJ is the first one to view them. Next was Naomi. I'm still affected by it, goddamn.

==19 - --== I slept for 20 hours.

==20 - --== I just had the greatest fucking idea ever—I'm gonna "gamify" my life. I've created a system that lets me play a character (myself) and lets me level up certain different aspects in my life—and a bunch of other stuff. I'm super excited to try it out!

==22 - 23:04== Today was (kinda) tiring. I haven't slept yet and I did half of the 12 pomodoros. I also packed stuff for moving and went to the new house a bit. I worked out and watched a film afterwards.

==24 - 2:46== I did nothing but listen to music all day yesterday. I tried to implement the "gamify life" on Google Sheets but I realized it would be ultra hard to manage, especially when it's actually micro-managing my every move. Plus, my devices won't handle it if I have a massive amount of data.

==27 - 00:16== I've been sleeping the entire day. But not continuously, I wake up in the middle, do random stuff, then fall asleep again. I don't feel like doing anything, to be honest. CJ deleted her Telegram account, but not without deleting all our conversations. I don't know what to make of it but that's not the reason why I feel lethargic, it's just kind of weird for her to do it. But really, I don't even know her to begin with. Yesterday I felt weirdly relieved, for some reason. Like a wave of acceptance washed over me. Like none of this matters in the grand scheme of things.

==28 - 3:49== I've been sleeping a lot lately. I also haven't showered for 4 days. I don't know if I'm depressed. I'm listening to CJ's new playlist. I'm inclined to think it's about me somehow, or maybe it's just my limerence speaking. But anyhow, I'm listening to it and imagining what could've been us. I feel a sense of disconnect to it now, it's been so long already.

## March 

==1 - 23:00== I didn't study today, just watched 3 films and listened to music. I did work out though, kinda getting used to it. Surprisingly, I woke up early (and felt sleepy early). Here's to restarting sleep cycle.

==3 - 3:09== I woke up at 9 AM, did a few exercises on Javascript, procrastinated by listening to albums, lots and lots of music. I drank three cups of coffee and had lots of motivation and ideas to make art. By night time, my younger sister and I went to buy BBQ Bacon Snackers at KFC.

==5 - 23:06== I watched a lot of films and did a lot of art stuff today and I'm proud of my progress, especially with color study. I'm looking forward to digital painting more.

==7 - 23:57== I'm so addicted to making art that it's all I can think about and do all day. Am I becoming manic?

==10 - 3:06== I spent all day yesterday playing Roblox and listening to albums.

==14 - 2:17== My siblings and I played DnD, it was fun.

==16 - 23:47== I spent all day playing Roblox. I made a friend on Youtuber Tycoon. I listened to Bitpop albums and made a Roblox gaming playlist. I'm just now realizing I've been hyperfixating and I'm probably hypomanic and I'm once again contemplating if I have ADHD or nah. Why did I ever think I can live a normal life?

==19 - 23:28== I'm feeling fucking fantastic and I want to die. I think it's safe to say I'm manic now, my excessive intake of coffee triggered it. I'm so ambitious, I want to create everything and anything and I'm the greatest person to ever exist.

==21 - 23:28== I hate myself so bad but it feels crazy good to live I wanna end it.

==23 - 23:24== I played video games all day and listened to music. I feel irritated and bland. It's a hot day.

==25 - 23:21== I wanna self-sabotage so bad.

==26 - 1:35== I met a girl from Finland who's Pinoy. We talked for a bit. I watched ***End of Evangelion*** today, I cried. That was intense. I still hate myself.

==27 - 00:34== I dreamt of CJ again, nothing new. We didn't play DnD today. My teeth fucking hurts, I couldn't eat. I'm still talking to that girl from Finland.

==29 - 1:26== I wanna kill myself so bad.

==29 - 22:59== MY TEETH HURTS I CANNOT FOCUS.

==31 - 00:59== My left cheek is swelling where the toothache was. And I'm not feeling so good. I don't know if it's the excessive intake of coffee + lack of food + health anxiety or it's actually getting worse. I don't think I'll sleep today.

## April 

==1 - 1:32== My left cheek is still swelling and I think it's gotten worse. I drank Co-amoxiclav and it still haven't reduced the swelling. Hopefully later when I drink another one, the swelling will lessen.

==1 - 23:21== I spent the entire day journaling ***Evangelion*** lore. My face is still swelling, my tooth ached for a little bit (I drank Mefenamic Acid), and I'm not sure if the antibiotic is working or my condition is getting worse.

==3 - 22:53== I played Roblox all day yesterday. My cheek is swelling less. My mind is racing with all the possibilities and I feel giddy to do everything—every single one of my hobbies and interests. I am aware I'm becoming manic but I have no choice but to succumb to it.

==4 - 22:28== I woke up later than intended and it pissed me off so bad that I just discarded all that I planned to do for the day. I was feeling kind of depressed when I woke up but I have the energy to do shit, I just don't know what. I can't focus either. In the evening, mom, dad, and I went to Puregold to buy groceries. I ate some California *maki* and cheese *samosa*. Tomorrow is the day we'll go to the dentist. I'm kind of scared, I don't feel like sleeping at all.

==6 - 18:35== Yesterday, my mom, my younger sister, and I went to see the dentist. I was so anxious that I was shaking—I had to listen to music and hold my mom's hand during the process. They filled in my teeth's holes. After that, we went to eat ice cream and burgers. We will go back to the dentist this Saturday. I couldn't play much today because my brother stayed at home instead of working outside.

==7 - 21:28== I slept for the majority of the day.

==8 - 23:30== We went to my aunt's dental clinic to check our teeth. I went with my mom, dad, and younger sister. My aunt just cleaned my teeth but she was having doubts with what my previous dentist did to my recently swollen tooth. I'm getting a lot of anxiety just thinking about the toothache coming back and me going back to the dentist to take care of it. It is throbbing, I'm very anxious. Anyways, Kanola and I have been getting along pretty well—we agreed on a meet-up when she comes back to Philippines. Also, ate MJ is now in Manila and it kinda sucks to see her IG stories knowing I can't invite her to meet-up along with Louise and CJ.

==12 - 1:15== I woke up real late yesterday, I couldn't do what I had to do. I ate with my left teeth and it was okay. My dad treated me and my younger sister with Minute Burger, I was really craving for food. My sister still isn't talking to me. I feel kind of depressed and self-deprecating.

==12 - 8:27== I don't feel like doing anything at all. I hate myself and my artworks a lot.

==14 - 4:30== I slept for a really long time yesterday. I only got to finish watching one film.

==15 - 12:17== I had a haircut today, really short—I like it. My sister and I are talking again. Life is okay.

==20 - 22:08== I was playing ROBLOX and listening to albums when we got the news that there is electricity now on the house that we're gonna move into. I guess my mom got too excited we decided to celebrate by eating food at the bazaar near the house. I ate some pizza and drank some fresh cucumber melon juice. But just then, when we got home, we learned that we still couldn't move into the house this Saturday unless the certificate of occupancy has been approved or something. So I guess still no moving. We got excited for nothing. The electricity is a start though. I'm feeling very lonely. I barely talk to IC and Lou anymore, not even Kanola. Not even my younger sister. I don't know. My life right now is very stagnant, there is no excitement at all. I want to move houses already so we can all move on.

==24 - 13:43== We still haven't moved houses but there is electricity at the new house now. We cleaned there yesterday then we ate at the food bazaar at Linear Park.

==27 - 22:23== My back hurts. I've been listening to music all day. I also re-studied Javascript on Codecademy. I feel stuck on The Odin Project. I learned a few things, I'll continue next week.

==29 - 23:39== The busiest past 2 days of my year so far. But alas, we've finally moved houses—after 3 months of waiting. The house is in a chaotic state, the space is cramped but we can manage. After all, we're already used to the moving house shtick. I've been extra focused on studying Japanese lately. It's kind of addicting.

## May 

==2 - 20:06== My dad's car is broken and can't be fixed anymore so he returned it to his company. There's no guarantee for a replacement so I'm here anxious about not having a car anymore. I mean, what's the point of moving here then? We needed the parking lot. Now that we finally moved to an apartment with a parking lot, we don't have a car anymore. We should've just went to *Angono, Rizal*. You win some, you lose some. Gonna have to get used to not having a car again when travelling.

==4 - 1:18== I woke up late yesterday (around 4 PM). My family decided to watch the new D&D movie so I chose to watch with them. After that, I reviewed a little bit of Japanese from Lesson 16. Then, my younger sister and I watched ***Kimetsu no Yaiba*** until 1 AM. There has been strange noises all around, it makes me anxious. I'm not gonna sleep today.

==5 - 1:04== I can't sleep. There's so many things running through my mind, many things I want to accomplish. But I can't rest. I'm too excited. I'm going out for a walk at 6 this morning but I'm still not asleep. Should I just quit trying to sleep?

==5 - 00:13== I woke up late yesterday. I could only *study* Japanese from 6 until 11 PM. I'm not gonna sleep today, I have a lot to do. I want to set goals for my hobbies but something's stopping me. Like, I don't really care about the goal, I care about the process and how I enjoy it.

==7 - 23:25== Cheesecake was brought to our apartment today. She was stressed and anxious because it's a new house and new people. She was so stressed she didn't know where to potty, so she peed on my mom's bed. She stayed mostly on a corner with her head down, I think she's kind of depressed (because the first time, she didn't drink water and cried a little bit). I hope she warms up pretty quickly (and learns how to potty). I wish Mason was here, too. We all ate chicken burgers and Krispy Kreme while listening to some music and playing with Cheesecake. It's another good (but very hot) day.

==10 - 1:11== On Monday, IC came over and we had fun. We ate a lot of food and watched a lot of videos (and a movie) along with my sister. Today, I'm not sleeping, I have a lot to do. We barricaded our doorway so that Cheesecake won't enter and pee/poo on the bed again.

==11 - 00:17== I feel weak. I haven't eaten a lot because I didn't like the food. I also feel like crying because yesterday I dreamt that CJ and I got back together and we were happy. It's like I'm back at square one. I want to stop dreaming about her.

==12 - 00:38== I think I got IP blocked in RYM.

==13 - 2:21== I'm gonna finish the ***omnipresent hardwired teenage angst*** playlist today.

==14 - 00:27== I woke up late again and it's really starting to piss me off. I didn't have the strength or will to do my tasks for today so I just watched a Korean horror film with my sister. Mom and dad are at *Apalit*, they're not home yet. I hope this day would be better.

==14 - 23:30== I fell asleep around 8 AM and woke up 6 PM. My parents and my younger sister went to *Antipolo* to get mangoes and they ate pizza and chicken. I'm jealous.

==15 - 2:31== I feel groggy because I took my medication for tremors because I haven't eaten dinner yet. I also feel extremely lonely.

==15 - 12:47== I got RYM working again. We are so back. Also, I've done almost everything on my to-do list today except for Calisthenics. I have too much free time now. I didn't sleep.

==17 - 21:52== I didn't get to do my calisthenics workout today because I fell asleep around afternoon and felt too groggy to move. I've been drifting on and off sleep while reading a book.

==18 - 22:37== I listened to ***Everywhere at the End of Time*** by *The Caretaker* today from start to finish. I also had a nice talk with IC about life and struggles and being single, it was nice. I hope she's okay.

==19 - 19:36== I woke up really late. I don't feel so good. I skipped my antidepressants again. I feel a depressive episode coming. The yearning must've been the trigger.

==21 - 00:45== I fell asleep while reading a book again. I woke up kinda sluggish. I talked to my younger sister for hours about love life and stuff. I let her read what I wrote about CJ.

==21 - 20:09== I finished *Nathaniel Branden*'s ***The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem*** in one sitting. My sister and I cleaned our room. We both took a long shower afterwards. I don't feel as depressed anymore. It's an okay day.

==22 - 22:37== My mom, younger sister, and I went to NCMH. It went surprisingly well and easy. Afterwards, we ate at a Wendy's at Shangrila. Then, my sister and I worked out. We can't use water in the bathroom. My ego is unbearably big today. All I can think about is CJ.

==23 - 23:21== I slept for 17 hours, I couldn't do anything on my to-do list. I just watched two films. Also, I remembered my dreams, finally. I'm also glad I didn't dream of my internet friends, CJ, and Renson.

==25 - 22:52== I forgot to tell you, I've been talking to Renson since yesterday. We were talking about his relationship problems and my former relationship problems. He invited me to go watch a movie if everything goes to shit, I agreed. I feel like we'll be good friends. I've also been sleeping a lot.

==26 - 18:19== I've been sleeping all day. I have no energy to move and do stuff. I don't know what's wrong with me.

==27 - 6:02== I'm so numb. I want to feel something.

==28 - 00:26== Earlier during the day I couldn't feel anything, that was scary. Night came, I was listening to *Boris*'s ***Boris at Last -Feedbacker-*** album and looked outside my window. I felt something. I watched ***Bardo*** for good measures. I think I'll be okay.

==28 - 22:31== I didn't sleep, proved to be a good decision. I listened to music from midnight until 6 AM, then watched two films. My sister and I cleaned our room. Then, my sister, father and I watched a film together. We ate chips and berry juice. I chatted with Kanola, IC, and Renson all the while. Mom got home with pizza. I talked a little bit with my sister. My back hurts a little bit but it's a good day.

==29 - 23:55== It's so stupid. I woke up at 6 AM, fell asleep again, then woke up at 5 PM—completely ruining my schedule, AGAIN. Pisses me off.

==30 - 23:06== I didn't sleep, I listened to music. I studied Japanese. I fell asleep around afternoon and forgot to do Calisthenics. Fuck.

==31 - 23:00== SO ANNOYING. I fell asleep while listening to music and proceeded to sleep until evening. What the fuck is wrong with me?

## June

==1 - 21:52== I didn't sleep today, I just listened to music basically all day. I took a walk in the morning, showered, did my dailies, coded for a little bit, then listened to music for the rest of the day (and also journaled). I feel so fucking frustrated, depressed, empty, and irritated for no reason, I couldn't wholly enjoy my time. I also have this terrible back pain from sitting too long. It's my favorite day, my favorite weather, my favorite activities, and yet I feel so sour.

==3 - 00:28== I woke up late. I dreamt of CJ, and it was that kind of dream. I'm stopping myself from feeling bummed out because really there's no reason to be. My sister and I watched ***Demon Slayer***'s latest episodes.

==4 - 1:48== A lot happened yesterday but the most important thing is that I finally did Calisthenics again. I'm very determined to stick to it.

==5 - 00:32== I was so lethargic yesterday I couldn't do anything, I just slept the entire day.

==5 - 23:57== Almost didn't do what I had to do today but I pushed through. I cleaned my room (and the house) and bathed Cheesecake. I should be proud of myself.

==6 - 23:30== Fell asleep in the morning while watching a film, then woke up late. Older brother and I played LEGO Star Wars on his laptop. Dad bought chips and soda, mom bought barbecue. I finished the film afterwards. I talked to two of my Instagram mutuals. It was an okay day. I still haven't studied.

==8 - 00:03== I studied Japanese at 1 to 3 AM. Afterwards, I fell asleep while watching a film and woke up at 4 PM. Even though I woke up late, I still did my chores, bathed Cheesecake, and worked out. I knew I'll feel like shit if I don't do anything. I'm glad I did. I rewarded myself by watching three films.

==9 - 4:45== I've been listening to music for more than 12 hours. I feel neutral.

==9 - 20:10== I studied a little bit of Japanese in the morning. At noon, I cleaned the house and bathed Cheesecake. I took off a piece of poo on her fur. Afternoon, my sister and I didn't know what to do, so we watched a movie called The Wailing, which was a complete mindfuck. We bought chips and popcorn in the middle of the film (using my money) then in the evening we started watching Evangelion. I couldn't do my Calisthenics workout today. Promise I'll do it tomorrow.

==10 - 23:28== Long day. I met up with IC at Capitol Commons at 5 AM to walk around. We went to McDonald's to get coffee. We parted ways around 6:30. I went to Uncle John's (Ministop) in front of Capitol 8 to get a Tuna and a Pizza *Kariman*. It rained. I rode a Pasig-Palengke jeep because there was no San Joaquin. I decided to walk from *Kapasigan* to San Joaquin, because I'm short on jeepney fare. I worked out in the morning, took a bath, then studied *Kanji* and Maths. In the afternoon, my sister and I resumed watching ***Evangelion*** from 5 PM until 11:30 PM. I haven't slept yet and I don't think I will. I have a lot to do tomorrow. It was a nice day.

==11 - 00:44== I was supposed to not sleep today and stay awake for more than 24 hours, I failed. Fell asleep around 2 AM and got woken up by my mom at 5:30 PM. I immediately ate spaghetti and coke then resumed watching ***Evangelion*** with my sister. We finished the anime, as well as the movie finale. We were quiet the whole last 30 minutes. Even after the film, we stayed quiet. She went straight to sleep. Shit, that anime's still wild.

==12 - 23:16== Woke up late (6 PM), couldn't do anything. I didn't like the food but my mom made veggie *tempura*, I kinda liked it. Also my aunt gave me and my sister a tuna sandwich each. It was good. I don't feel like doing anything.

==13 - 23:58== I'm pissed. I fell asleep again and woke up nearly 6 PM. I only got to listen to music. I don't feel like doing anything. My sister and I went to Super 8 to buy our food for the night. My parents are short on money.

==15 - 21:54== Woken up by my sister at 10 AM because there was an earthquake. Good thing she did. If she didn't, I would've slept until 6 PM. I listened to music all day. I didn't code.

==16 - 20:07== I didn't sleep. I listened to my *deathdream* playlist while finishing a book. Then I started on a new book. By morning, I cleaned the house and bathed Cheesecake. Afterwards, mom, Cheesecake, and I went to the vet to get Cheesecake groomed and vaccinated. It went well. Cheesecake didn't get completely groomed but only sanitary, which costs only 250 pesos. I ate a *Kani* sandwich from 7/11. We went home, bought food and ice cream on the way. I suddenly had this HUGE urge to have my hair dyed blonde. My sister and I went out to ask the salon for the price, it was 2,500 for the bleach and color. I said fuck that, Imma just do it myself. I impulsively bought bleaching powder and oxidizer on Shopee with money I don't have. I can't stay still, I can't sleep, I can't focus on anything else—I want my hair dyed RIGHT NOW.

==17 - 23:36== I woke up late.... nothing new. I just resorted to listening to music and hope tomorrow I can do all that I have to do.

==18 - 23:19== I reviewed previous *Genki* lessons. My sister bought me 2 pieces of *turon*. We cleaned our room and I cleaned the house. I also watched a film in the morning. I didn't do Calisthenics, maybe tomorrow. 

==19 - 22:47== I woke up late (that should be my middle name now). My mom did my chores for me because I was asleep until past 3 PM. I just listened to music.

==21 - 19:40== Yesterday was kinda hectic. I got woken up by Shopee delivery and my mom doesn't have the money for it—we all went frantic. Good thing my dad was at KFC so we can send the payment through GCash, but the rider said he'll just come back later. Fast forward, my older brother has money now and my dad came home. We ate chips and barbecue and drank soda. Now, I have the money for the Shopee parcel. Also, I didn't change my Shopee address so me and the rider agreed to meet at KFC. I got my parcel, went home, was about to bleach my hair until my parents said we should just pay for a professional to bleach my hair. I keep asking my mom if that's allowed and she said yes she'll come with me later this morning or afternoon. I really can't wait. I hope it's allowed.

==22 - 00:10== Cheesecake is still sick. My mom and I went to the salon to bleach my hair. My hair's now light orange. Afterwards, my friends wanted to go celebrate Syra's birthday. So we went to her house. We were there talking and having fun from 5 PM to 10 PM. We drank a little bit. Then, Monica, Naomi, IC, and I went to a McDonald's to buy some coffee. I went home past 11 PM. My left cheek is starting to swell again, probably because of the alcohol. It was a good day though.

==23 - 00:03== Cheesecake is still a little bit sick but she's livelier than before. She took a bath, pooed twice. I did Calisthenics (no cardio). Mom and dad got home with stuff from my aunt who came back from the US. I got black shirts, a hoodie, a backpack, and some shoes. It was an okay day.

==25 - 23:00== My family was at *Batangas* this weekend. I had so much fun. I'll tell you all about it in a journal entry tomorrow.

==27 - 3:08== I didn't feel like doing anything at all yesterday. Now I'm planning to listen to music for 20 hours.

==27 - 22:03== Still didn't feel like doing anything. I just listened to music (but I fell asleep in between). I have to go back on track tomorrow.

==28 - 23:33== I didn't bathe Cheesecake today nor cleaned the house. I borrowed money from my parents and went out to eat with my friends. We waited at McDonald's for some time then went to *Buting* to eat *lugaw* and *mami* (and some milk tea).

==29 - 23:12== Fuck, I still can't do anything.

==30 - 23:15== I listened to music for most of the day, did my chores, and have a couple of spare time to mess around with my sister. I plan on finishing the book about bipolar children before sleeping. I can't wait to play laser tag with my cousins on July 8.

## July

==1 - 23:50== So fucking stupid. I planned so much today just to wake up late and do nothing. Congratulations, you played yourself.

==2 - 22:41== TIS A GOOD DAY, GOOD DECISION NOT TO SLEEP. I DID EVERY SINGLE THING ON MY TO-DO LIST AND ALL RIGHT ON SCHEDULE. LIFE IS HEALING. OR I AM BECOMING MANIC.

==4 - 00:24== I woke up at 6 PM yesterday.... couldn't do anything. I feel kinda depressed.

==4 - 23:21== So, my phone has trouble charging. I can't use apps which use a lot of the phone's processing power because they are battery-draining. I couldn't study, nor do I have the energy to go through my daily schedule. My phone will probably get fixed on July 31 so I'm taking a long break from being active on my Instagram. I already posted my notice, not like people would care a lot but whatever. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, I am not gonna make any plans or set schedule. I just watched Youtube all day.

==5 - 23:58== I slept for 17 fucking hours, couldn't do anything, didn't feel like doing anything. My life's more stagnant and I'm more lethargic. I didn't drink any of my meds today, I didn't want to. I don't know what I'll do now. I'm trying to stay on track but I just don't have the energy to do so.

==7 - 23:05== I slept for 16 hours, woke up at 4 PM to clean the house. *Mi Goreng* is the highlight of my day. I ate 3 packs, along with other food, like some kind of wanna-be Japanese. My sister and I watched a Korean horror film.

==8 - 22:06== Oh god, today was such a blast. In the morning, my parents were a bit cranky so me and my siblings were the only ones to go to SM Megamall. We first drank some tea on *19 degrees*. Then we did ice skating. It was so fucking difficult, I keep getting out of balance. I was really determined to not get out until I've learned how to properly skate—but my feet hurt so we got out. We ate fries in the food court. Then, we did one game of laser tag, it was exhausting but really fun, albeit short-lived. We ate our late lunch at the food court on the basement. I ate some Chicken *Karaage Bento* (which was lackluster). Then, we went to the bowling alley—they were packed. We went to the rock climbing center—they were also packed. So we stopped by first at Green Field to get some drinks, then we went to Ate Kea's condominium lobby to play board games. We played for 3 hours. We also ate a lot, again. We stopped playing past 8, my aunt booked us a Grab home, fully paid for. My body was aching all over when we got home, I even have bruises because of the skating.

==10 - 00:01== We went to Marikina to celebrate one last day with Tita Udi, Tito Ariel, and my cousin Andrew. We ate a lot of chicken wings and a lot of soda. My cousins and I watched 2 films: ***Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum*** (2018) and ***She's Dating the Gangster*** (2014). I let my sister look at CJ's stories and have her tell them to me, so that I won't have to see it. My brother and I was supposed to do a TikTok dance but we were going home. I got some new earphones today and an iPod Shuffle which I probably won't use. I also got a new cardigan, chocolates, vitamins, and panty liners.

==11 - 00:52== I met up with Kanola today at Ayala Malls Feliz in Marikina. It was a bit lackluster. I thought we weren't gonna meet because I've almost waited for an hour infront of the food court. Good thing I opened my Instagram. We finally saw each other around past 2:30 PM. I met her mom and brother. We played at Timezone and ate strawberry-flavored mini donuts. I also bought myself some Caramel Macchiato. Then, we did a bit of karaoke. Surprisingly I didn't get nervous or anything. We didn't get to watch a movie because the movies in the cinema suck. They made sure I got to ride a jeepney before they went. I didn't want to go home yet so I walked from *Kapasigan* to our house. I still had plenty of money left. My sister and I bought snacks at Mercury and then watched two films: ***Insidious: Chapter 2*** (2013) and ***Legion*** (2010). I don't want to meet-up with anyone for a long time, I've had my share of social interactions for the rest of the year.

==11 - 23:42== I fucking hate myself.

==12 - 23:32== I deactivated all my Instagram accounts last night. I don't plan on going back anytime soon. I feel kinda drained and unmotivated. Jhanna opened up to me about how she was planning to kill herself before her graduation. I'm scared for her sake.

==13 - 23:04== I used the laptop to listen to albums. I didn't play ROBLOX nor learn Javascript. I'm excited to study Japanese tomorrow. Two Shopee parcels came today. I got grey masks instead of black. I got a really large notebook which was wrapped immensely.

==14 - 23:33== I reactivated all my Instagram accounts. I can't stay off for a long time. I wanna fucking kill myself.

==16 - 00:16== Couldn't do Calisthenics nor study Japanese yesterday. I still wanna die.

==16 - 23:49== I woke up too late for my Calisthenics workout but I studied Japanese so that's good. I don't hate myself as much as yesterday.

==17 - 23:53== Felt so lazy when I woke up at 2 PM but I bathed Cheesecake. I also managed to do my goals for Japanese today. I am currently rewriting stuff (as a process of remembering).

==18 - 23:23== I'm getting obsessive again. All I can think about is studying Japanese and becoming better. I spent hours earlier just rewriting notes like a maniac. I couldn't feel my hand. I slept during the day and woke up writing again. I just know I'm gonna get burnt out once more.

==19 - 23:05== I FUCKING HATE MYSELF. (I watched ***Memories of Murder*** with my sister by the way. And my parents gave us money for snacks and savings.)

==20 - 23:51== I made art again after fearing creating again. It was messy and spontaneous but I'm glad I did it. I just had to let everything out. I was still unbelievably sad afterwards but I got some load off. I slept for a long time but I studied Japanese in the evening.

==22 - 00:49== I listened to *tricot* and *Ichiko Aoba*'s discography yesterday. I replied to my crush's story (she still haven't responded (and she probably won't)).

==22 - 22:43== Dad took Mom to the hospital early morning because she couldn't stop vomiting and having diarrhea. He woke me and my sister up to watch her at the hospital emergency room. He gave us enough money and load. I ate 2 *onigiris* from 7/11—I was delighted to find out they had some. Anyways, only one person was allowed inside so my sister stayed at 7/11 and I watched over Mom. I took care of her medical certificate and withdrawing money. She immediately got discharged though as she's feeling well already. She bought a lot of meds at San Joaquin while me and my sister went to Super 8 to buy creamer and sugar. I went straight to sleep as soon as we got home and woke up late in the evening.

==24 - 00:15== Yesterday, I intended to listen to music for 20 hours straight. I was doing good on my 10-hour mark but I fell asleep. I still persisted though and I barely finished my set goal, I had to do a bunch of other stuff. It was okay, I guess. We celebrated my younger brother's birthday. My older brother, his wife, and their child, visited. We ate a lot of food and drank a lot of soda. It was very chaotic inside my sister and I's room. They left around 11 PM. I still want to die.

==25 - 20:42== I didn't sleep. I decided to restart my Odin Project progress and make a new GitHub account to re-ignite the excitement of coding. This time I'm going to use the laptop more frequently. I skipped both of my meds yesterday and I want to skip them today, too. I think I'm becoming hypomanic.

==25 - 22:21== I haven't slept yet. I almost thought I was going to lose a hold of myself earlier in the morning. I was extremely agitated, frustrated, suicidal, and almost delusional. Just because I skipped one day of meds, haven't slept, and drank fuckton of caffeine. I'm really slowly killing myself, aren't I?

==27 - 1:20== I slept for 23 hours.

==27 - 23:09== I read 3 books. I breezed through HTML and CSS, I'm now on Flexbox. I finished *Galileo Galilei*'s discography. I'm so pumped up, I want to never sleep and just study so fucking hard.

==29 - 1:38== I woke up late yesterday. I talked to Renson for hours. He told me about his relationship and I told him about mine and CJ's previous relationship.

==29 - 23:17== I finished *Genki* Lesson 19 today. I read a few books. I watched films. Took a nap. Listened to music. I'm depressed and numb again.

==31 - 00:32== I almost killed myself last night by drinking all my pills. But I smoked 3 cigarettes instead of dying. Then I slept all day.

## August

==1 - 23:24== I just slept the entire day. I did take down notes for my Japanese studies though so that's something.

==3 - 00:00== I studied Flexbox and finished 6th grade math on the laptop yesterday. Then I watched 2 films with my sister. I fell asleep while reading a book.

==3 - 22:22== I studied Flexbox (the rest of it) and one topic for Math. Afterwards, I just felt extremely sad and empty that I'm too immobilized to focus on studying.

==4 - 21:03== I went through all my posts in my archive account. It literally took me the entire day.

==5 - 22:06== My phone got fixed today for 1,200 pesos. I rode the car with my dad to the repair store. We bought coffee and donuts. My sister and I binge-watched the 24 episodes of ***Banana Fish***.

==6 - 21:33== I woke up late and didn't get to clean my room nor do Calisthenics. I used my brother's laptop instead to listen to music. I basically did nothing. I feel empty.

==7 - 21:18== We cleaned our room today, my sister and I. Mom helped us. I also got a new desk setup. It's actually a vanity table but I turned it into a desk. Our room feels very spacious now. I practiced *Kanji* for *Genki* Lesson 20. We ate burgers and I watched ***Black Mirror*** episodes with my sister in our new clean room.

==8 - 23:58== I slept around past 3 with palpitations and chest pains. I woke up past 12 noon. I got anxious and suffocated with our dog. My family and I ate egg salad sandwiches and talked about films. I did a 30-minute Calisthenics session. I studied Japanese.

==9 - 22:43== It's like everything is going right these days. Today, dad bought brewed coffee—it was so good. My charging cable arrived today, too. I didn't eat anything the whole day because I was too focused on studying Japanese. I thought of doing a commonplace book for my Japanese studies and that's all I've been doing the entire day. I seriously can't wait for my 400+ paged notebook to arrive—I can't sleep because of it.

==10 - 22:12== Got 3 hours of sleep. Finished a playlist while reading and drawing. Finished CSS Flexbox exercises. Also finished Middle School Biology and its notes. Listened to some albums while I took IQ tests. I got an IQ of 121 on MENSA. Studied Japanese at night. Finished scheduling my entire year for my studies. I am hypomanic.

==11 - 23:35== The milk and my commonplace book arrived today from Shopee. I spent the entire day writing and drawing while listening to music. I haven't eaten anything, just coffee (I'm shaking so badly).

==12 - 23:13== Studied Japanese for 9 hours straight. I'm becoming active on Instagram. My desk is fucking godsent. I feel so good about myself.

==13 - 23:21== Woke up around 5 PM. I learned how to draw the external oblique, studied the tarot card ***The Empress***, did a short punching animation for practice, then read a few chapters of ***Beck*** (manga). I dreamt of a romantic dream with Jia instead of CJ.

==14 - 23:36== Woke up 4 PM. Studied the taro***t card The Emperor***, did my dailies, finished 2 units of 7th grade math (I had trouble with rates and percentages), had difficulties concentrating, found out my crush has a boyfriend (after dreaming about her being my girlfriend). Sad day.

==15 - 21:03== I did everything in my to-do list, fucking proud of myself. I listened to music, drew, watched 2 films, read a book (in-depth), studied 2 math units (7th grade), listened to 2 podcast episodes (in-depth), played the guitar, practiced singing, watched another film—and I still have a lot of energy left in me! What disappointed me was constantly checking my Instagram even though I swore not to open it, not until 12. I'm still checking if CJ viewed my stories, fucking pathetic. Oh well, I'll try again tomorrow. I'm excited for tomorrow.

==16 - 21:00== I fucking slept through the entire day and woke up at 4 PM. I still did some of the things on my to-do list, I just wasn't able to study Math or do Calisthenics.

==17 - 21:05== Thursday, laptop day. Finished the CSS project landing page. Accomplished 2 math 7th grade units. Listen to a few albums, re-listened to songs, albums, and playlists while simultaneously adding genres to my *shit to listen to* list series. My back hurts all the while. I'm gonna study more tomorrow, I have to become accustomed to studying for long periods of time.

==18 - 22:57== I didn't get to do my laundry. I did review a bit of Japanese, listened to music, worked out a bit, and did an artwork. I also read a few chapters of *Eckhart Tolle*'s ***The Power of Now***—which was liberating. I feel so much at ease now.

==19 - 21:31== End of the week. I did some stuff: studied, learned a tarot card, did calisthenics, learned a choreography, read a book, made a sketch for an artwork—that's all I can remember. I'm listening to music right now, I don't have anything else to do.

==20 - 22:39== I built a small "stress" weighing scale made out of folders and tape. It's wonky and jerry-built but I had extreme fun during the process—that's what's important.

==21 - 22:15== I woke up early again and did everything in my to-do list—plus more free time! I feel less limerent over my ex now. I think I'm happy.

==22 - 22:56== I woke up early but went back to sleep an hour later. I couldn't do some things in my to-do list but I did accomplish my study goals, which was already good. I didn't do calisthenics nor did I attempt to get a certificate of indigency.

==23 - 21:44== I didn't sleep. I went to NCMH and had my check-up, didn't get my meds though because I don't have a certificate of indigency. I was too self-deprived to study so I just watched a film.

==24 - 22:58== I listened to music and organized my RYM list basically the entire day. I only finished studying one Algebra 1 unit. I also did an in-depth reading for an hour.

==25 - 23:41== I slept well into the afternoon but I still managed to study, even for just a few hours.

==26 - 21:46== I didn't study today, nor did calisthenics. Nothing much happened, I was asleep for the most part of the day.

==27 - 23:26== Studied, did calisthenics, used the laptop to listen to music and arrange my RYM list, read a book.

==28 - 23:24== I fell asleep while listening to music again. I skipped calisthenics. I studied for almost 4 hours though. Afterwards, I read a book.

==29 - 23:34== I did nothing. I just slept the entire day until well into the evening.

==30 - 23:24== I studied. I did calisthenics (I'm really gaining biceps, triceps, and abs). I learned ***The Hermit*** tarot card. I made the first scene for my animation (though I'm not satisfied with it). I read a book.

==31 - 23:16== I slept late so I woke up late. But I used the laptop and studied for a few hours. I spent the rest of my day organizing my RYM list while listening to music. I also read a book.

## September 

==1 - 23:18== Slept so late and woke up late again (6 PM). I still studied though I didn't finish a single unit. I read a book before I did my night routine. I didn't brush my teeth because I'm planning on drinking coffee while studying (I'm not gonna sleep).

==2 - 22:38== I didn't sleep. I studied for more than 5 hours. I managed to finish the last (long) unit of Algebra 1. I took a long break in the middle watching Youtube videos about Japan's homeless. I was too tired to study High School Geometry so I just listened to music and sketched heads. Then I finished *Haruki Murakami*'s ***A Wild Sheep Chase***. I did calisthenics for more than an hour. I took a shower. Realized I'm getting a lot of acne on my back and shoulders so I have to shower regularly. Then I watched ***Gummo*** with my sister. We had a quick conversation afterwards.

==4 - 2:29== I slept for 19 hours yesterday.

==4 - 20:43== I didn't sleep. Studied some new Japanese vocabulary. Listened to my playlist. Revised the first scene of my animation. Read *BECK*. Watched 2 films. Couldn't focus on studying, just read a book instead. Did some intense calistenics. Felt a little pressure on my lower back so I had to lie down. In bed at quarter to 9.

==5 - 23:14== Starting to see a pattern here: I'd be awake for an entire day and then sleep for an entire day. Same shit happened again today. I did lift a bit though but I didn't study. I read a book.

==7 - 6:14== I didn't sleep yesterday. I tried studying math but I was so stuck on geometry that I wanted to cry. Then I went out for a walk. I walked from San Joaquin to Capitol 8 and back. My goal was to reach Uncle John's and buy *Kariman*—I did. I walked 10,955 steps and more than 6 km. I also listened to a podcast. I listened to my playlist while reading a book. I'm finally doing an analytical reading of a book and I'm finding it to be so much fun. I finished scene *1 of her pt. 3 (limerence version)* and started on scene 2. I read a few chapters of ***BECK***. I watched a film called ***American Mary*** (2012) and it was good, surprisingly. I ended up sleeping early (around 7 PM) because I was really sleepy.

==7 - 23:19== I went out and bought 2 *onigiris* and one sandwich. I ate them while listening to music and organizing my RYM list. I studied JavaScript and science (I really enjoyed science so I continued doing it until 10 PM). I finished 2 playlists and I listened to one album. I continued my analytical reading.

==8 - 21:57== I woke up late (11 AM) and slept again and woke up at 6 PM. My sister and I bought roasted chicken and coke for dinner. I watched ***Air Gear*** (it's fucking full of ecchi). I didn't feel like doing anything because I skipped most of everything but I did a summary of a chapter of a book I'm reading. I also don't feel like doing my night routine so I'm heading off to bed.

==9 - 23:15== I woke up at 2 PM, I didn't feel like doing anything. But still, I did calisthenics, albeit not wanting to. Afterwards, I studied Japanese. My brain's kinda not working, I keep forgetting words and grammar points. Then, my sister and I went to Mercury with Cheesecake. She bought me cookies. We, then, watched a film—with it kept on buffering. I didn't get to read a book.

==10 - 22:30== Whiteboard markers arrived today while I was studying Japanese. I finished the workbook exercises for *Genki* 2 Lesson 21. I also practiced *kanji*. Then, I was only supposed to do a few UPCAT math practice test problems but I ended up answering everything because it was so fun using the whiteboard marker on my mirror. I got 83 out of 100 correct.

==11 - 22:31== I slept at 5 AM and woke up with an acid reflux. It sucks. But my commonplace notebook arrived today. Anyway, I slept again and woke up to go to the barangay hall with my mom to get a certificate of indigency. When we went home, I went out again to photocopy my certificate and my ID. When I got back, I immediately wrote on my commonplace book until 7 PM. I still have acid reflux. It really sucks because apart from the uncomfortable sensation on my chest, I can't drink coffee. I didn't feel like studying so I just updated my animation, read manga, and helped my sister with her presentation. I also didn't feel like doing analytical reading for now so I prepared for bed early. I think I'll just read *Haruki Murakami*.

==12 - 23:17== I went to NCMH to get my meds. When I got home, I slept like a log for 10 hours. When I woke up, my sister is crying in front of my parents and venting her frustrations. It was a heartbreaking yet heartwarming situation at the same time. I didn't get to do most of my things in my to-do list but that's okay, there's still tomorrow. I won't sleep today.

==13 - 22:26== Despite great reluctance, I weightlifted a bit, studied one tarot card, showered, studied and drew some anatomy, and did an analytical reading.

==14 - 23:39== I mostly listened to albums and organized my RYM lists. Then, I studied a bit of JavaScript and biology. I finished my analytical reading of *Vasant Joshi*'s book ***If It Could Happen to Buddha, Why Not You?***. I haven't thought of my ex FOR AN ENTIRE DAY.

==15 - 23:51== I watched 2 films. I studied one tarot card. I did calisthenics and a bit of cardio. I practiced a song on guitar. I ate many tuna sandwiches.

==16 - 23:28== I used the laptop to organize my Youtube playlists and my RYM lists. I studied the tarot card ***Death***. I listened to a podcast, ate tuna sandwiches, cookies and some coffee. Watched a little bit of ***Akira*** with my sister. Fell asleep, didn't do calisthenics, woke up to watch ***Air Gear***, dropped it, then read a *Haruki Murakami* book while listening to 2 albums. I felt a little bit sick the entire day.

==17 - 23:31== I did *kanji* practice. I learned the tarot card ***Temperance***. I finished unit 3 of high school geometry about congruence (thank fuck). I did a bit of skimming through *Viktor Frankl*'s ***Man's Search for Meaning***.

==19 - 23:47== I used the laptop yesterday, I completely forgot about writing here about it. Today I finished unit 4 of high school geometry. I read a few chapters of ***BECK***. I weightlifted, and read ***Man's Search for Meaning***.

==20 - 23:22== I did my daily Japanese exercises. I studied high school geometry—trigonometry is actually fairly easy so far.

==21 - 21:59== I used the laptop to listen to playlists and albums while organizing my RYM lists. I almost got scammed with a job offer on WhatsApp but I landed on a real job offer I found on Google. I'm excited for it.

==22 - 23:39== I applied for the job. My interview is on Monday or Tuesday at 6 AM. I ate tuna sandwiches today and created my own Japanese dictionary—I've been writing for hours and I'm still not done. I'm postponing current plans and just restart my week.

==23 - 22:52== I finished writing down my Japanese dictionary. I have about 1,368 words and phrases in total. I also took down notes on the company CyberBacker and bookkeeping responsibilities and requirements. I also took down notes for accounting and everything I learned on senior high that I think are relevant to the job I'm applying for. It's a fairly quick day because I woke up late. Wish me luck.

==24 - 23:22== I slept late and woke up late. I studied Japanese and finished superficial reading of a book. Tomorrow is the day but I should act like it's just a normal day.

==25 - 22:37== I slept for some 2 hours before the interview. I prepared and all but 6 AM came and the Zoom link is not working. An hour passed and still no interview, they removed me from the meeting. Welp, no interview, no job—that's just life.

==26 - 22:40== I haven't done calisthenics in a week. I haven't showered for days. I still haven't done my laundry. I used the laptop today and finished the Rock-Paper-Scissors project on Javascript in The Odin Project. Lou finally talked to me. It feels weird.

==27 - 23:00== I finally did my laundry. But afterwards, I just fell asleep until evening. I didn't do calisthenics again nor clean my room. At least I did my laundry though. Baby steps.

==28 - 23:14== I finished studying high school biology on Khan Academy while taking notes and also listening to my playlists. I did a bit of analytical reading then decided I'm gonna watch one short film a day, as well as listen to one album a day. So that's what I did before writing this.

==29 - 23:12== I studied Japanese all day. I'm really doing this, huh?

==30 - 23:23== I woke up late. I studied a little bit of Japanese. I watched the new ***Adventure Time*** sequel ***Fionna & Cake***. I was trying hard not to cry.

## October 

==1 - 23:22== I woke up at 7 PM. I didn't do much today, I'm annoyed.

==2 - 22:39== Surprisingly I woke up early, around quarter to 10 in the morning. So I immediately folded my clothes and cleaned our room. Then my sister and I watched ***Time To Twice***. I couldn't focus much on my Japanese studies but I had a rant-y conversation with Lou. I'm finished with the analytical read***ing of Man's Search for Meaning***.

==3 - 23:09== Slept for a looong time. I studied Japanese a bit.

==4 - 23:03== I'm manic.

==5 - 23:18== I'm not manic. I didn't get to use the laptop today because I woke up late. My sister and I watched the first few episodes of ***Fairy Tail***. I practiced some new *kanji*. We have food again (and coffee).

==6 - 00:22== It dawned on me how cripplingly lonely I am, and it's my fault.

==7 - 23:49== I did a lot after midnight but fell asleep in the morning while listening to a podcast. I woke up in the afternoon and watched ***Fairy Tail*** with my sister.

==8 - 23:49== A lot has been going through my mind.

==9 - 23:24== Unberable sadness. My parents are out. I smoked again.

==11 - 00:13== I cut Lou off for the mean time. I just watched films all day. Didn't feel like doing anything else. I dropped my phone—it has cracks now.

==11 - 23:01== Fuck.

==12 - 23:12== Didn't sleep. Mood got better. Used the laptop. Listened to music. Watched many films. Bought a lighter. I am completely alone in the universe.

==13 - 23:28== I wrote a rather emotional journal entry last night. I posted it. No one really cared, I guess except for Kanola. I smoked two cigarettes today on the bridge while listening to *Deftones*. I'm down to only 13 sticks.

==14 - 23:00== I want to run away from everything.

==16 - 00:02== I just watched films and read books. I hate my fucking face right now because of endless acne.

==16 - 23:36== Insatiable yearning.

==17 - 23:58== I slept for 17 hours. I want to just study Japanese for the rest of the week.

==19 - 1:14== I didn't sleep. I studied Japanese the entire day. My parents bought groceries. I also got to get out to buy burgers and so I smoked, too.

==19 - 23:19== I woke up early and used the laptop. Decided to make a new RYM list based on my the ultimate playlist of my life list. I'm so excited to start *Tobira*.

==20 - 00:30== I slept for lotsa hours. I woke up and I forgot what I did. I still haven't started *Tobira*. I spontaneously watched ***Corpse Party***.

==21 - 22:47== I finally started *Tobira*.

==22 - 23:02== I fucking slept all day.

==23 - 23:44== Cried because of how lonely I felt. Slept for the most part, continued my RYM list.

==24 - 23:02== I finished making notes for my RYM list. I wanna kill myself.

==25 - 22:40== I don't have the energy to do anything. I finished my RYM list though.

==26 - 23:18== I used the laptop. I tried to study JavaScript. I couldn't start Math or Science, I couldn't focus properly. I just listened to a 3-hour long album and finished one of my playlist. I watched a film afterwards and slept.

==27 - 23:52== I fucking slept all day.

==28 - 23:00== I wanna kill myself so bad but I also don't wanna die.

==29 - 23:08== Today was surprisingly better. I studied Japanese for the most part by making Anki flashcards. It made me feel better.

==31 - 00:00== I dreamt of CJ and Renson....

## November 

==1 - 21:56== I did everything in my to-do list while also adhering to my new routine, as well as my new sleep schedule. I slept more than 8 hours but still managed to do everything, can you believe it? I smoked two sticks, too! It's a good day.

==2 - 21:57== I finally started studying again.

==3 - 22:29== I did mostly everything in my to-do list. I remade my Twitter account into a Japanese art account. I followed a bunch of Japanese people.

==4 - 22:08== I overslept. I came back to my Instagram accounts.

==5 - 21:37== I overslept again. But I still managed to study Japanese. I did legs and cardio today. I started a new anime. My sister and I watched the last episode of ***Shingeki no Kyojin***.

==6 - 21:37== I feel overwhelmed with our dog, she keeps on barking—it's really starting to get on my nerves. I want to just run away.

==7 - 20:46== I still want to run away.

==8 - --== I worked out today even though I didn't want to.

==9 - 22:18== I had a good study session today. We ate sisig for dinner.

==10 - 21:58== Sleep routine got messed up. I studied Japanese for most of the day. I drank black coffee.

==11 - 21:19== Woke up late. Parents went out. Studied Japanese most of the day.

==12 - 22:22== I am very active on Twitter and AniList.

==13 - 23:03== Jia (the other one) unfollowed me on my private account. I may have done something wrong or I was not worth it to be around or something. I'm overthinking.

==14 - 21:37== I fell asleep while watching a 4-hour long film (I was not supposed to sleep).

==15 - 21:40== Fuck I overslept again. We ate KFC today because my dad got his salary.

==16 - 21:43== I was supposed to use the laptop today but my brother asked if I can just use it tomorrow because he needed it today, I said okay. I managed to research a bit about skin care and save anime series to my watch list before giving the laptop back. I ended up just studying Japanese (naturally) and watching Japanese Youtube videos.

==17 - 18:20== I didn't sleep. I used the laptop. I typed out tarot card meanings, then journaled about issues with myself. I decided to delete my private personal Instagram account. I already saved photos and videos, and uploaded them to my Google Drive. I was also supposed to delete my archive account but I figured I wouldn't. It's my safe space, I can't just delete it. I had nothing much better to do for the rest of the day. I took a shower, wrote down the recipe for *Oyakodon*, and redid the first scene of my animation. I'll be sleeping early today.

==18 - 22:56== Even though I slept for a long time, I still woke up late. I just watched Japanese Youtube videos and ate chips. I'm currently reading a Bubbline fanfiction.

==19 - 21:53== We celebrated my birthday today. We ate sushi and chicken *cordon bleu* (which I helped make). I spent most of my time continuing my animation. It was a good day.

==20 - 22:07== It's my birthday today. It's just like any other day. My older sister gave me money. I'm not sure what to do with it.

==21 - 20:51== I woke up late again. I didn't get to do my laundry. I just read a book and listen to my playlists.

==22 - 19:58== I did my laundry. I spent my money (all of it). I photocopied my ID. I did calisthenics, both arms and core. I changed my towels. I masturbated the instant I was home alone.

==23 - 20:00== I woke up at almost 10 AM but I managed to do everything in my to-do list. I researched about *haka*, typed down tarot card meanings, finished all the loops and array JavaScript exercises, finished a unit test in math, started high school physics and then answered some *Anki* flashcards. I also ate *Shawarma* Rice today and fed our dog some fried chicken.

==24 - 21:11== I went to NCMH to get a prescription and my meds. I mostly watched stuff today. I ate *onigiri* and chicken cordon bleu. It's a good day.

==25 - 23:57== I slept for 18 hours. I woke up at 3 in the afternoon. I just read books and drank coffee. My parents aren't home.

==26 - 19:56== I wasn't supposed to sleep but I fell asleep in the morning and woke up in the afternoon. I just read all day. My mom bought me burger and ice cream.

==27 - 23:09== I woke up at 3 PM. I just wrote grammar notes for Japanese. I finished a playlist.

==28 - 19:15== I just read all day. My lip piercing came today.

==29 - 20:58== I just read all day (again). I finished three books.

==30 - 21:53== I mostly just listened to music. I researched about the *ophanim*, the definition of self and self-actualization. I wrote down steps to achieve them. I felt like hyperfixating.

## December 

==2 - --== I used the laptop even though I did nothing. My brother bought pizza. My parents brought coffee. I redid my routines and schedules and implemented one day of break from studying. Life is okay.

==3 - 19:33== Today's my break day. I didn't sleep. Bored and hypomanic. I cleaned my room and the house. Went out to buy sanitary napkins. Finished ***Mr. Pickles***.

==4 - --== I woke up late (4 PM). My dad has brewed coffee. It's so fucking good.

==5 - 18:59== I haven't slept yet. I read for hours while listening to music. Then I continued my animation. I felt groggy so I skipped studying Japanese and just did arm calisthenics (core for tomorrow). Mom ordered me and my sister to buy food. We bought burgers, juice, *turon*, rice, and milk. There was an earthquake but we didn't feel it. I used the laptop and (fixated on) customized my RYM. We talked of plans. Today was a good day but I need to sleep soon.

==6 - 21:10== Surprisingly, I woke up early. I drank brewed coffee and studied (a bit) of Japanese. I did both arms and core calisthenics.

==7 - 22:43== Busy day. Mom cooked burgers for their church. I'm a bit overwhelmed and annoyed because she haven't gotten a wink of sleep yet. Though I helped clean the kitchen and house. My sister and I also bathed Cheesecake. I used the laptop all day customizing my RYM and listening to my playlist. I also talked to strangers on Instagram and on Discord. It was nice. I feel very devil-may-care mode today. It helps me get rid of social anxiety but I get a little apathetic and insensitive.

==8 - 23:00== Went out with my mom to get our dog groomed and vaccinated. I ate pizza and drank Caramel Macchiato. It was a nice day. I listened to music, too. My sister and I went out at night to buy food at Mercury. I ate fudge brownies and drank Coke. I feel a bit lonely and melancholic though.

==9 - 23:43== I cried due to crippling loneliness and existential sadness. My mom got sent to the hospital. I listened to music all day. Our dog chewed my earphones. I'm only using one earbud now. My brother gave me money to buy myself a new pair of earphones.

==10 - 22:33== We didn't go to the buffet today. I forgot it's my dad's birthday. I finished ***Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann*** and also wrote a review.

==11 - --== For hours, I used the laptop because my brother went out. I stayed at a VC channel in the *SINEGANG* Discord server with my camera on. I chatted with people and somehow I felt comfortable doing so. I finished my biology *Anki* flashcards.

==12 - --== I decided to take a break until the end of December. I'm really bored. I've been sleeping a lot. My earphones aren't here yet.

==13 - 23:10== My earphones came today. I cooked rice twice. I cooked our lunch: sausages and ham. I bathed Cheesecake. I sweeped the house. I also cooked *Tinola*. My family said it was good. I feel like an adult.

==14 - --== I listened to *The Caretaker*'s ***Everywhere at the End of Time***. I customized my Discord video call screen through OBS. I had fun. I didn't sleep.

==15 - 21:38== I watched ***Aftersun***, it wasn't great. I woke up late. My mom arrived home with chicken sandwich and blueberry banana waffle, I ate both of them. My mom, my sister, and I, took our dog to get vaccinated. We ate ice cream. We bought a fuckton of barbecue. I was really full.

==16 - 13:49== I played "song prompts challenge" with my sister where we choose a song for each prompt in a challenge I made. It was really fun. Then I talked to a stranger about my situation. They changed the trajectory of my life. I reopened my personal private account and now I'm figuring out how to approach Louise and CJ. My sister, mom, and I went out to Mercury to buy food. There was a loud explosion on the street but nothing dangerous.

==17 - --== I got back together with my internet friends. We talked on a Telegram call. I'm happy.

==18 - 21:38== I got back together with Lou. She talked to me about her love life. CJ and I are also planning to meet up this week.

==19 - --== Couldn't sleep, didn't sleep. Hypomanic, bored, can't focus on anything. Too excited for what's to come. What is coming?

==20 - 20:32== I slept for 9 hours. Couldn't fucking focus on anything. All I can think about is what's gonna happen tomorrow. I'm bored, annoyed, hypomanic, and understimulated.

==21 - 21:47== The meetup with CJ didn't happen. Me playing ROBLOX with Lou today didn't happen too. My mom taught me how to cook *adobo*. I feel hopeful and at peace.

==22 - --== I played ROBLOX with Lou. I applied to jobs. My sister and I went to 7/11 to buy food. We watched two films.

==23 - 23:12== Went to my niece's birthday at my older brother's. We had fun.

==24 - 23:37== I slept and listened to music for most of the day. I didn't get to help cooking. We ate macaroni salad and mango-graham cake.

==25 - --== We went to *Marikina* to celebrate Christmas. It felt stale and different. I still got money though.

==26 - --== I met up with CJ. We went to SM North, to Antipolo, then back to SM North. I had fun. But I realized I didn't like her that much at all romantically.

==27 - --== Went out to meet with friends. I drank GSM Blue Mojito and smoked 4 cigarettes.

==28 - 22:42== Woke up late. Went to Market Market with my younger sister. We played Timezone and ate corndogs. We also went out to Mercury. We watched ***Oldboy***.

==29 - 22:08== Went out to get our dog vaccinated. Went out to buy groceries. Learning a song on the guitar, by ear.

==30 - 18:22== Applied to jobs. Journal arrived today. I designed the cover pages.

==31 - 21:22== I spent most of the day reading my 2023 journal entries. I reflected on them. I ate only a little bit today, I'm getting sick of eating.

## January

==1 - 21:34== I almost went crazy during the morning because I couldn't sleep. I skipped my meds last night. We didn't go to my aunt's to celebrate New Year's. I fell asleep but only a short time. I got a job interview while reading a book. I worked out. I ate chips while watching ***Train to Busan*** with my sister and mom.

==2 - 20:21== I woke up really late. I got a phone call from a kitchen crew job and Shopee. My *Celeteque Hydration* came today. I printed 7 copies of my résumé. Tomorrow's a big day.

==3 - 23:22== I went to a job interview today at Quezon City. I passed the initial screening. I took an assessment at a company. I'm waiting for the results. I ate at a Pizza Hut alone. I fell asleep immediately when I got home.

==4 - 22:15== I went to another job interview at Quezon City. I passed the initial screening again. I took another assessment. I'm waiting for the results, too. I ate onigiri. I reviewed *Tobira* chapter 1, listened to some OPM, and did arms and core calisthenics.

==6 - 00:45== Yesterday was hectic. I went to Concentrix to apply for a job. After several hours, without final interview or looking at my résumé, I got hired. I'll start on Monday. I walked home from Megamall to San Antonio. I drank 3 levels of Lemon-Dou.

==6 - 21:33== I went to MOA with my younger sister to meet my older sister. We ate at *Botejyu*, talked about our dating lives, then got coffee at Coffee Bean.

==7 - 22:50== I didn't do anything but chill for most of the day. Tomorrow is a big day.

==9 - 2:59== First day of training at Concentrix. It was really fun. I met a lot of people. I wasn't entirely alone at all.

==10 - 00:12== 2nd day of training. I went to get my medical examination. I almost didn't make it on time. It's also my second day of smoking for lunch break.

==11 - 00:05== 3rd day of training. Also my 3rd of smoking since the start of the year.

==11 - 23:44== 4th day of training: a lot happened. My work crush kept flirting with me after she found out I'm gay (even before that).

==13 - 1:08== 5th day of training: my work crush kept flirting with me the entire day every chance she gets. Only now did the tiredness sink in my system.

==13 - 22:51== I woke up at almost 5 in the afternoon. I (tried to) learn how to balance on bike.

==14 - 23:41== I went out with IC to Greenfield. She treated me to Turk's, an iced white mocha at Pickup Coffee, and a lemon cucumber drink at the food bazaar. Then we just chatted and played guitar. I talked to Lou about the meetup with CJ and my work crush.

==15 - 23:45== 6th day of training. We started PST, we discussed a lot of shit, mostly technical stuff. Anne hugged me twice today. I talked to the GC about it, I told them I'll stop having a crush on Anne from now on. I also admitted to Lou that I feel jealous every time CJ opens up about her work crush.

==16 - 23:24== 7th day of training. I let Camille borrow my jacket. She played with my hair. I told her she's beautiful.

==17 - 00:02== 8th day of training. We discussed a lot of shit. I think I'm having a crush on Camille.

==18 - 23:34== 9th day of training. We did Side-By-Side at the production. We chatted with other agents. It was fun, though Camille was sick today, she didn't talk much.

==19 - 00:32== 10th day of training. We did Side-By-Side again. We took a few quizzes, I passed every one of them. Camille and I went to the training with matching green flannels.

==20 - --== I dreamt of CJ. It was that kind of dream. I'm feeling quite melancholic today.

==21 - 23:25== I did almost everything of my hobbies. I won't sleep just so I can finish my scheduled tasks.

==22 - 23:25== 11th day of training. We did MSV. JP provided the answers for the written assessment. I got 28 out of 30. We did SBS again, we kind of also got into trouble with another trainer. Dean cried. I couldn't interact much with Camille, but I'm really glad she came.

==23 - 23:44== MSV day 2. We all passed the final assessments like a breeze. There were some adjustments. Us trainees got separated into two groups. I told Arjay, Dean, Roxy, and Ken about my crush on Camille. I'm with Camille and Anne on Ticketmaster UK. I probably avoided interacting with Camille all day and she probably noticed.

==24 - --== Nesting day 1. Pressured to solve tickets. New environment. Solved 4 in total. Flirting with Camille.

==25 - 3:22== Nesting day 2. 3 hours sleep. Got NBI clearance, stayed at office 6 hours before shift. Walked around Megamall. Stayed at McDonald's. Solved 5 tickets. Got easiest ones again. Flirting with Camille again. Problems, sadness, realizations about employment and workmate bonds.

==26 - 5:01== Nesting day 3. Anne's not talking to me and Camille. I tried talking to her, even mentioning I had a crush on her, but now I have a crush on Camille. I tried to fix things with Ken, Roxy, and Ella. Camille hid my phone. One of Ticketmaster's British executives did SBS with me. I wasn't nervous, but I was also numb. Dean, Roxy, and I sang at the 11th floor playroom videoke at our office. Then we went to *Jollikod* to smoke and eat cheeseburgers. Today was really eventful.

==28 - 22:53== I've been asleep for more than 24 hours. I talked to Camille. We confessed we both liked each other but she actually has a girlfriend for 6 years now. I'm heartbroken. I invited CJ to rent a room together and drink on Friday.

==29 - 3:35== Nesting day 4. 7 tickets solved out of 9. I told Roxy, Dean, and Ella about my situation with Camille. Camille flirted with me again.

==30 - 5:04== Last day of nesting. I seriously had fun. I got accepted to production, along with Sarah. The rest will do extended nesting for 3 days. I had my closure with Camille, too. I feel incredibly sad.

==31 - 4:52== First day of production. Camille came to work. Sarah and I were placed with the nesting team again. We solved a few tickets for the day, we're taking it easy. Someone airdropped me an image saying they like my hair. I wore a pink blouse to work.

## February

==1 - 4:44== First real stress and weariness at work. SME unaccommodating, trash attitude. Went back to Instagram, posted photos of CJ and I, as well as Wave 50.

==3 - --== Anne didn't pass the nesting. She cried and cried. We drank until the morning came. I paid for half of it. I went to an AirBnB with CJ. We drank and had fun. We slept beside each other on the bed. We took a lot of photos and videos.

==4 - --== CJ and I spent the morning together. I treated her to coffee, and we doodled at the coffee shop. I went to Cubao with my sister to thrift clothes.

==5 - --== I had my hair bleached and dyed. First day of work of the week, no team. Disappointed with performance. Emptiness, dissociating, wanting to go home.

==7 - 3:48== I talked to Louise on Telegram about her current situation. We both felt relieved afterwards. First time working around my team mates. PCs weren't working. It took me more than 3 hours of my shift to start ticketing. My PC was laggy. Gab helped me with my tickets. I was called out by TL twice, almost got a payoff. I don't really care much. My spirits got reinvigorated though. CJ is nowhere to be found.

==8 - 4:29== I kept drifting in and out of sleep. I almost didn't want to go to work, just to sleep. Work was okay. I found the girl I was with on the elevator when my colleagues and I sang at the 11th floor videoke.

==10 - 6:20== Work was great. My performance was okay. I sang at the videoke room on 11th floor with Dean and Roxy. I ate three cheeseburgers. I felt so thirsty.

==11 - 3:55== I slept for most of the day yesterday. Then at night, CJ and I talked about her crush for almost an hour—on call and on chat. I felt crushed for absolutely no good reason.

==12 - 00:20== I slept for almost the entire day just this Saturday. Feeling kind of pissed. But I spent the rest of Sunday doing an analytical reading of the current book I'm reading and have been putting off for a month. I feel kind of liberated from what I've been reading.

==12 - 15:04== Went to work, didn't have work, went home. Our TL's shitty. I went to Capitol Commons with my sister to record a song cover. I was feeling really hyperactive and impulsive—I felt a strong urge to resign already. I was also really talkative.

==15 - 3:29== I mean, it's okay. Work was okay. I was actively avoiding work but it's okay. I'll be fucked sooner or later, but it's okay.

==16 - 4:17== I didn't want to go to work so bad. I've been talking about resigning all day. There were no tickets to solve.

==18 - 2:27== I've been spending a lot. I spent ₱500 for food alone. Then ₱2,100 for random accessories on Shopee (and a thick journal notebook because I want to rewrite my commonplace book). I want to die.

==18 - --== My friends—IC and Syra—and I went to Escolta at Binondo, Manila. I haven't slept yet. I drank a lot of coffee. I spent a lot of money. I had fun, but I still wanted to kill myself. I broke down around 11 PM and all I could think about is killing myself. I talked to Lou on the phone.

==19 - 23:46== I did nothing all day but sleep.

==20 - 23:47== I did nothing but rewrite my Japanese notes (and eat).

==22 - 9:19== I rewrote all day since yesterday while listening to my ***the ultimate playlist of my lif***e playlist. I think I'm starting to move on from CJ.

==24 - 2:38== I'm over CJ but I feel so incredibly sad about it. I made vent art regarding that feeling. I'm also hungry.

==25 - 00:06== I'm gonna give my mom my commonplace book as her journal. I haven't finished rewriting everything yet so I won't sleep just to finish this. I bought coffee.

==27 - 1:35== 2 days ago I showed CJ all the artworks I made about her. Today, I still feel sad that I've moved on. I did nothing all day but sleep.

==27 - 23:44== I did nothing but sleep and read. I don't feel like doing anything. I feel so sluggish, unmotivated, and exhausted for no reason.

==28 - 23:33== I was so depressed past midnight but I felt well during the day (and night) probably because my dad has money now.

## March

==2 - 5:53== Highly annoyed and frustrated yesterday because Instagram kept deleting my post. I used the laptop and I tried to calm myself down by listening to music. I fell asleep around afternoon.

==3 - 22:46== Didn't sleep just to finish ***Beyond Good and Evil*** by *Nietzsche*. I had a date with CJ. It got awkward and silent near the end. I can barely say I had fun. I feel so shitty the entire day, I wanted to die. I smoked 4 cigarettes today and now drinking alcohol.

==4 - 23:42== I was so out of it past midnight since I wanted to induce psychosis. I gave in and slept though. I woke up feeling extra shitty. I cut myself in the bathroom, it didn't hurt. I felt better afterwards. CJ still hasn't replied to me. Kanola stopped talking to me.

==6 - 1:58== Went to NCMH to get my meds—I didn't get all of them, they ran out, I have to come back tomorrow. I bought a new notebook. I still want to die.

==7 - 20:12== I recorded a cover of ***Sextape*** by *Deftones* at Capitol Commons at 3 AM yesterday. I needed that get-away to breathe and be alone with my thoughts for a short while. I also smoked. I got my meds in the morning at NCMH, then slept for an entire day.

==8 - 23:36== I started studying again.

==9 - 22:27== I fucking fell asleep. I couldn't do everything I planned on doing. I woke up at 5 PM and I'm too lazy to start anything at that point.

==10 - 19:26== I didn't sleep. I studied a bit and recreated my entire 2024 goals list and schedules.

==11 - 22:06== Tried out my new routine, I actually woke up fairly early for it. Got through halfway, did a lot, stumbled a bit, and then after the (semi) workout, I just stopped following my plans. I've decided to journal on paper from now on. I'll still continue this though.

==12 - 23:13== Electricity got cut off in the morning. I journaled a lot today. I'm addicted to checking my socials.

==13 - 21:32== I slept until 6 PM because I wanted to continue the dream I was having about me reading CJ's journal entries about me.

==15 - 23:10== After staying up until the next day to study yesterday, I fell asleep around nighttime and slept well into the afternoon of the next day. I did nothing but read today.

==16 - 22:40== I didn't sleep. I didn't continue studying. I almost went insane but I fell asleep thankfully. I feel so fucking shitty throughout the entire day.

==17 - 23:58== I watched a lesbian romcom at midnight because I couldn't sleep. After that, I almost went insane again. But when I fell asleep, I slept for the entire day.

==18 - 20:15== I haven't slept yet. I finished Chapter 2 of *Tobira*. I hyperfocused on cutting out pictures from my science books for a bit. My mom rearranged our room. I feel new and hopeful. Also, I'm obsessed with making art now.

==19 - 22:42== I slept the entire day. Mom made delicious stir-fry noodles for dinner.

==20 - 21:29== I didn't sleep. I feel like shit. I don't even remember what I did all day. I'm so empty and lonely and so depressed. I can't feel anything.

==21 - 23:08== I didn't feel like doing anything. I don't feel anything.

==22 - --== I used my brother's laptop. I restarted Odin (again). I think this is the leverage that I needed to push me out of this depression. Also, I'm addicted to journaling.

==23 - --== Went to Marikina for a small family get-together at a resort with pool. We sang at a videoke. I learned how to float. I wanted to go home.

==24 - 22:48== We stayed at the vacation house until 12 noon. We played games, I received no money. We drank coffee at Starbucks. Then I felt an excruciatingly aching loneliness. I used my brother's laptop. I won't sleep.

==25 - 21:50== We took Cheesecake to get groomed. I drank Cafe Latté (mom had Strawberry Milk, it was great) and we shared a pizza. I might not enter college this year. I plan on passing the JLPT N3 on December, get a certificate, then get a Japanese translator job next year.

==26 - 23:15== Erica Jayne Ambrosio messaged me on LinkedIn.

==27 - 21:42== Feeling a little lazy.

==28 - 22:37== Finished my Japanese pendings. I also finally did one Calisthenics session. I rewatched ***Imagine Me & You*** with my sister. I've been talking to a girl I met on Instagram.

==29 - --== I woke up past 5 PM, ruined my schedule for the day.

==30 - 21:29== I didn't sleep. I listened to *Panucci's Pizza*'s discography, as well as my other pending playlists. I used the laptop to listen to music and update my RYM and Goodreads.

==31 - 22:32== Hyperaware of everything. I realized the sole reason I can't love is that I'm too self-absorbed. I reached out to my friends and asked them how they are.

## April

==1 - --== I was so unbelievably starving but thank god there's food. I couldn't focus properly because I was sleep-deprived.

==2 - 23:06== I finished *Tobira* chapter 3 workbook exercises. I started taking note of all unfamiliar kanji I come across. I fell asleep until 5 PM. We ate "vegan" burger with rice. I drew for 3 hours.

==3 - 23:08== I tried to fall asleep past midnight but couldn't so I ended up making a list with all the films on *effedupmovies.com* in alphabetical order. I woke up past 6 PM. We had burger with carbonara sauce/gravy for dinner.

==4 - 23:05== A calm, aware kind of day. Life's not that great financially speaking but there are a lot of things I'm thankful for, and I should be thankful for.

==5 - --== I studied HTML on my brother's laptop then listened to some music. Mom bought coffee.

==6 - 23:50== Mostly listened to music today. I made an artwork, a messy one, it was really fun to make. I got lost in the process, the good kind of lost.

==7 - 23:53== I didn't clean the house and my room. My parents and my older brother are at church the entire day. I almost ran out of time.

==8 - 23:39== Probably a little hypomanic. I did a lot of art today, and other stuff. I introduced new features in my bullet journal and new habits.

==9 - 23:25== I woke up past 5 PM. I finished my dailies on time.

==10 - 23:35== I finished my Math and Science tasks for the week. I'm also on track for Japanese. I slept for 7 hours in the afternoon but no problem doing my daily habits.

==11 - --== Woke up late, didn't have the energy to do anything because there's no coffee.

==12 - 23:40== A bad case of anhedonia, watched Youtube all day but regained my footing around the evening.

==13 - 23:57== Slept late because of a *Bubbline* fanfiction. Woke up late and my parents and older brother aren't home. I used the laptop and finished all my tasks for the month for programming.

==14 - --== I cleaned my room and our house. I rearranged my desks and my journaling stuff. I was so tired I just fell asleep and abandoned my night routine.

==15 - 23:32== I just want to do nothing and laze around.

==16 - 23:54== 1.5 liters of coffee and no sleep inducing hypomania. I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING BECAUSE I WANT TO. I'M SO GREAT, NO ONE CAN COMPARE.

==17 - 23:36== Of course I woke up late. My parents went grocery shopping.

==18 - 23:19== I didn't sleep. I did a lot of shit. I'm enthusiastic and excited for what's to come. We ate homemade pizzas and burrito at 10 PM for dinner.

==19 - --== I couldn't sleep past midnight, I was manic. But then I passed out.

==20 - 23:57== I made a large mixed media artwork. I think it's my best one yet.

==21 - 22:49== I listened to one playlist of mine then made an edit.

==22 - 23:33== I made a Youtube video of one of my playlists.

==23 - 23:26== I was bordering psychosis in the morning and I was having headaches because I willingly skipped my antipsychotics last night. I was delusional and completely out of it, then I passed out asleep for 10 hours. I hate myself when I woke up and I regret inducing mania.

==24 - 22:15== I feel kind of lethargic and... subdued. I drank my antipsychotics last night after all.

==25 - --== I slept for most of the day trying to finish listening to my playlist. I ended my day discussing about random shit with my sister.

==26 - --== A mixed episode. I was having suicidal thoughts while having all the energy in the world. Everything made me want to kill myself. I was so alone. There were black spots in my peripheral view.

==27 - 23:18== I slept for 19 hours.

==28 - --== We cleaned our room and the house. I was suicidal by the end of the day.

==29 - 23:46== I slept for 20 hours.

==30 - 23:44== I got admitted to the psychiatric ER. My mom and dad came to get me but we had to wait for hours before we decided to just go home.

## May

==1 - 23:02== I managed to do everything today. I feel at peace.

==2 - 23:20== I procrastinated a lot. I didn't take a walk at 5 AM. I did a lot of art though.

==3 - 21:28== I woke up late. I didn't take that daily morning walk.

==4 - 23:36== Couldn't sleep during the night. Didn't sleep. Felt sleepy during the day. Fell asleep.

==5 - 23:45== Fell asleep around 4 AM when I wasn't supposed to sleep.

==6 - --== I didn't sleep. I had to study even if I didn't feel like it. We had burger steak with gravy.

==7 - 23:42== Felt a little burnt out but still passionate as ever.

==8 - 23:47== Woke up to our house flooded. Then fell asleep for 11 hours.

==9 - --== I skipped studying for 9 hours. I should stop doing everything on my bed because I'd feel lazy.

==10 - 23:24== I didn't study code today but I did a lot. I finally experimented on GIMP. I organized my RYM lists. I set an appointment at NCMH.

==11 - --== Used the laptop to transfer Obsidian notes.

==12 - 21:58== I didn't sleep so I can transfer all my commonplace book notes to Obsidian — I succeeded. I was going out of my mind, hearing things, seeing things, my brain imploding in on itself. It's mother's day, my mom lost her 500-peso bill and found it in the trash. I watched a weird unique film with my sister, went out under the scorching heat and talking with my sister, and art journaled while listening to K-pop with my sister. I ate burgers, and Korean beef, and squash soup. Everything's so fast, I can't stop.

==13 - 22:27== I've been asleep for 22 hours. I feel like shit.

==14 - 23:09== I slept a lot. I started reading ***What Does The Fox Say?***

==15 - 23:56== God, I feel like shit.

==16 - --== I've made my decision. I'll be getting a job again. I'll stop with all my planning shit for now and reassess.

==17 - --== I countinued writing *kanji*. I finished watching season 1 of ***Jujutsu Kaisen***. We ate KFC.

==18 - --== I finished reding ***What Does The Fox Say?***

==19 - --== I finished watching ***Angel Beats!*** and then started binge-watching ***Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season***.

==20 - --== I didn't sleep. I went to a coffee shop with my family and played games there while drinking beverages. I stayed at the park and recorded myself talking.

==21 - 23:44== Day 1. I woke up at 8 AM to walk for 30 minutes. I fell asleep around noon for 7 hours. I still did my habits.

==22 - 23:46== Day 2. I couldn't sleep so I didn't sleep. I failed masturbation once, succeeded on the second time.

==23 - 23:45== Day 3. I binged ***Whisper Me a Love Song*** (6 episodes) then slept for 15 hours. I still managed to do everything except for studying.

==24 - 23:19== Day 4. Woke up late (5:30 PM). Walked at 9 PM with my sister and bought coffee.

==25 - 22:50== Day 5, didn't sleep. Went to Marikina with my mom and younger brother, got a lot of cool new stuff and got stuffed with food and air-conditioner. I played COD Mobile with my sister and finished watching Bottoms. It rained the entire day.

==26 - --== Day 6. It's a Sunday. I made this my rest day (unintentionally). I didn't make a daily spread.

==27 - 23:37== Day 7. Contemplating on restarting the mission because I barely did anything and it's already been a week. My sleep's still fucked.

==28 - 21:41== Day 8. Didn't sleep. Set up my old laptop. Did a productivity setup tour 2024. Downloaded a bunch of albums on my other laptop. Feeling like my brain stem's about to snap.

==29 - --== Day 9. Miraculously woke up early for my morning walk (with my sister). I used my brother's laptop to download albums and art inspiration photos. Went to this niche cheap but good coffee shop near us with my sister while the rain's pouring hard.

==30 - 22:58== Day 10. Younger sister's Moving Up day. I didn't do anything productive except for read and plan my next five days.

==31 - --== I skipped my dailies again and used my brother's laptop to download anime. I decided to restart my 50-day mission because I failed.

## June

==1 - 23:20== DAY 1. Didn't sleep past midnight. Finished ***Yuri is My Job!*** Felt depressed when mom told us about our financial situation. Did my morning walk, albeit unwillingly. Fell asleep around 1 PM, woke up at 7 PM. Successfully did a full cardio workout.

==2 - 22:53== DAY 2. I didn't sleep again. I edited stuff then watched ***Saw II***. I took my morning walk as usual, used the laptop to download a bunch of shit, watched ***PSYCHO-PASS***, fell asleep for 9 hours, then continued watching. I listened to my playlist on my laptop and edited its metadata (added lyrics and shit).

==3 - 23:32== DAY 3. Slept a lot, but also did a lot of studying (a bit). It's hot even if it rained.

==4 - 23:18== DAY 4. Changed up my routine and sleep schedule. Still didn't clean the house, my room and folded the clothes.

==5 - 23:35== DAY 5. Watched a lot of anime. I guiltlessly made all my tasks too easy so that I can have time watching anime. I customized my Anilist profile. I skipped my antipsychotics.

==6 - 23:53== DAY 6. Barely did anything. I watched an anime called ***Blood-C*** while listening to hyperpop while download anime and albums and playlists while talking to my sister. I fell asleep around 12 and woke up at 9 PM.

==7 - 23:03== I decided you can re-do a day with this challenge because I did absolutely nothing but watch anime today.

==8 - --== I stopped the 50-day challenge. I found it pointless now. I feel like everyone's the same and everyone's leaving me—or I desire isolation. I'm determined to live on my own.

==9 - --== I slept for 16 hours. Did laundry with my sister, then watched anime.

==13 - 22:43== I've just been watching anime while waiting for the parcel that I ordered from Shopee to come, bought with the money my uncle and aunt gave me. I started talking to Chai. I like being alone in my room and I purposefully don't fold my clothes so that my mom can't sleep beside me. I feel so pathetic and I just want to go far away.

==15 - --== I used my brother's laptop to download Proko videos and practices. I'm left alone with Cheesecake in the house. I cleaned the house and washed the dishes. I want to do a lot of things but I haven't got much time.

==22 - 23:32== Went to meet up with Chai at Cubao Expo. She treated me to food, I bought her stuffed toys. I was so tired when I got home but I still drank coffee. My family went to Apalit. I tried downloading albums and anime but the internet's too slow. When I got home, I want to kill myself because I hate myself.

==25 - 22:55== I had a depressive breakdown in the bathroom early morning. Chai tried to calm me down. I fell asleep.

==26 - 23:47== I feel like shit.

==29 - 22:54== I'm reigniting the spark of living once more. My dog bit my lip today and I'm fearing I'd have rabies. I might just die.

## July 

==1 - --== Depressed. Slept all day.

==2 - --== Went to buy groceries with mom and dad. Ate a lot of food.

==3 - 23:16== Made and ate sushi. Watched ***Chainsaw Man***.

==4 - --== I slept for 20 hours.

==11 - 23:04== Went to Marikina for a religious event (fiesta). Got so overwhelmed by so much people that we just went home.

==13 - --== Mom's in the hospital and I'm making a 130-day plan of becoming the greatest artist alive.

==20 - --== Chloe's debut. We had so much fun. We stayed overnight at the venue.

==21 - --== We played DnD until 5 AM. I slept so well. We went to eat at a mall and got coffee.

## August

==17 - --== I spent most of the day talking to Chai. I had fun. We also opened up about our sexual desires for each other and how we both wanted to be intimate but just scared.

==18 - 22:27== I (barely) tried to do things I planned but ended up getting sidetracked by torrenting films for Chai (I used my brother's laptop). I also helped my younger sister with her schoolworks while listening to music. My head was spinning and I felt weak when Chai sent a bunch of images of her.

==19 - 21:46== I hyperfixated on reading all my past conversations with Chai.

==20 - 23:43== Drifting in and out of sleep the entire day. Chai and I became officially girlfriends. I'm the happiest person in the world right now.

## September

==7 - 22:24== Trying to get my life back on track because I plan on getting an actual job before September ends. I finished *Haruki Murakami*'s ***The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle***—I'm not going through with my goal of reading all of his books.

==8 - 21:51== I used the laptop to sort emails and look for an accounting job. Then I played ROBLOX and Plato with Chai. I am determined to learn Financial Accounting in 3 weeks before I get an accounting job. I also talked dirty on Instagram with Chai. By the end of the day, she was having a bad day.

==9 - 21:32== I fell asleep for 11 hours after waking up to my 6 AM alarm. I had a very heavy dream about my girlfriend killing someone then wanting to kill herself. My sleep schedule is ruined again.

==10 - 20:34== I listened to playlists after midnight until morning came. I studied Accounting and stopped at the Problems section of the textbook. My phone won't charge. I talked to my sister while my phone charged. My plans for the rest of the day is kinda ruined. I feel insane.

==11 - 23:29== I slept for 18 hours, didn't do any chores at all. I played Mobile Legends with my girlfriend and my younger brother.

==16 - 1:13== Chai has been here since Thursday. I cried to her earlier, told her my child sexual abuse trauma, then she fingered me real hard.

==18 - 20:30== Chai went home today. I was feeling a little sad about it. But I needed to recharge. I think I have a new hyperfixation (Mobile Legends).

==27 - 22:05== It's my 7th day at Chai's house and I'll be here until Monday. Plenty has happened and I feel like I've entered a brand new phase in my life, as well as shedding a new skin of my own. The next 3 days might prove to be the most difficult days to pass by as it will affect my girlfriend very much—or it'll go by like a breeze. I hope all goes well. I hope to god all goes well. Even if it doesn't, I'll do anything and everything in my power to stand strong for her.

==28 - 19:35== I'm still at Chai's. Her mom didn't go. I still sent her the 500 pesos.

==30 - --== I went home from Chai's. We walked around Trinoma first before I went home. Then, I randomly took a job interview spontaneously. It took me around more than 2 hours long during my trip home. I was so tired. It felt unfamiliar as I got home. I got attached to my girlfriend's house.

## October

==1 - 23:55== I spent almost the entire day sleeping. Then I uploaded me and Chai's images and videos on GDrive. Then I posted on Instagram, and replied to all her posts. I also updated my ***the ultimate playlist of my life*** list on RateYourMusic.

==2 - 21:37== I spent my day doing what I love most—at the cost of leaving Chai to her own devices. But I'm not her savior. If she's sure to herself that she'll be fine, I'll trust her.

==3 - 22:02== I woke up late then got on a phone call with Chai. I did one page of Anki flashcards.

==4 - 22:00== Stayed up listening to music, then rewatched a fucked up Japanese film called ***All Night Long*** (1992) dir. *Katsuya Matsumura*. Then I spent the night talking to my girlfriend on chat and on call—I sang her to sleep, too.

==5 - 22:49== Slept for 15 hours. My sister and I bought Minute Burger and ice cream.

==6 - 20:57== I slept for 11 hours. I haven't cleaned neither the house nor my room. There are no clean sheets and towels. My family has gone to church again. I just watched ***Aku no Hana***. I felt energized to study again.

==7 - --== I didn't sleep because I finished ***The Power of Now*** by *Eckhart Tolle*. I went to NCMH with Chai, then we went to Cubao. We got intimate because we were the only ones home then she ate me out.

==8 - 21:52== Chai woke me up at 10 AM. Our aunt treated me, Chai, and Chelsea at KFC. Chai and I watched ***The Substance*** (2024). Then we played Mobile Legends with her cousins (and my younger brother). I was feeling discouraged but that was a sign of weakness and an opportunity of improvement if I chose to do so. I was also dissociating the entire day and my mind wasn't there.

==9 - --== Chai and I went out to smoke and drink energy drinks. I smoked 5 cigarettes.

==10 - 22:34== I felt the side effects of my antidepressants around 7 PM. I was shaking and I felt weak.

==11 - --== I don't think I did anything remarkable today. I just spent it lazing around with my girlfriend.

==12 - --== Chai and I watched ***Maquia***.

==13 - 22:08== Still no internet. Chai and I were left at the house because they went out. We had sex, had breakfast, watched Evangelion, talked about our plans, learned how to scissor, watched porn, kissed and cuddled. 

==14 - 20:49== I woke up late. There's still no internet. I listened to albums on my laptop while I read a book about bipolar disorder. I registered my SIM for internet for 7 days (8 GB). I went out with my sister to buy Strawberry soda drink at House of Blends.

==15 - 21:06== I fell asleep and then woke up in the afternoon so lethargic and anhedonic. The coffee, around half a liter still, has gone bad. I'm paralyzed and stuck to my bed.

==16 - 20:50== The internet connection came back. I read a book the entire day while listening to albums on my laptop. There's barely any food here. My younger sister's classmates came. I put oyster sauce on all my meals. I still feel anhedonic.

==17 - 19:50== I woke up late (2 PM instead of 6 AM). I just read a manga called ***Gajuu***, then downloaded the raw version because the translation got cut off at chapter 32. Chai went to the doctor and learned she has an ear infection. She'll be taking lots of medicine starting today. I helped my sister with her math homework (inverse functions and exponential functions). I only ate *pancit* with a lot of mushrooms. This is the last of my coffee.

==18 - 20:52== Chai woke me up at 6 AM through call and we talked for an hour. I made *kanji* flashcards then read raw versions of mangas. The internet got cut off because we didn't pay for this month's due yet. I played the guitar. Chai, my sister, and I wrote about what love means. Chai wrote the greatest love letter of all time and it's about me. My family and I ate chicken for dinner plus rootbeer. I'm so in love with my girlfriend.

==19 - 7:40== Chai woke me up at 6 AM again, she was a bit quiet. I immediately started drawing. Then she told me of the possibility of her living in Japan with her aunt and I was devastated, I couldn't stop crying. I didn't feel like drawing anymore. Later, my sister and I bought food, ate together and laughed and she told me about her love life, and also about how my mom told my aunts about my girlfriend.

==20 - 22:28== 2nd monthsary with Chai. She made me a website (again) and posted photos of us. I went to Antipolo with my mom. It was exhausting.

==21 - 23:04== I woke up late. My phone died because I didn't charge it before sleep so Chai didn't get to call me at 6 AM. I was on a phone call with Chai for an hour. My sister and I went out to buy stuff at Super 8.

==22 - 21:57== I didn't sleep until 5:30 AM. I listened to ***Frou-frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires*** by *Cocteau Twins* the entire night. I suddenly didn't feel like doing anything, I felt miserable. Then Chai woke me up in the morning through phone call, only for me to sleep again until 4 PM. It was raining all day. I finished ***クロマチ***.

==23 - 22:57== I finished making science Anki decks. Chai seemed cold and distant today, perhaps because she's sick right now and a lot's going on. Still I can't help but feel like I did something wrong.

==24 - 22:26== Chai was in a better mood today, then fell off as she was about to sleep. I spent some time with her playing Plato while she was waiting at the hospital. I did a cover for ***26*** by *Paramore*. Before I slept, I sent Chai messages about my thoughts about her and our relationship.

==25 - 22:05== I woke up with Chai replying to me about how she loves me, too. I watched ***Her*** (2013) by *Spike Jonze* (and cried) and made an edit. I had a VC with Chai and we just tried the face filters the entire time.

==26 - 21:24== I slept for most of the day. I couldn't do the things I was supposed to do. I was on a video call with Chai. She flashed me, and sent nudes—I got really horny.

==27 - 23:33== Chai went with me and my family to the cemetery on impulse. We all had fun, especially with my cousins. We stayed at the cemetery from 4 PM to 9 PM. Chai went home with us, and I thought she'd stay, but she went to her cousins to drink with them. I felt a little disappointed.

==28 - 21:53== I allowed myself to wake up extra late and catch a few z's because I was tired. I mostly did laundry today. Chai came back and stayed for the night.

==29 - 21:56== We went to Arellano University to get my sister's report card. We didn't have money. Chai and I walked from *Pag-asa* to *Kapasigan*. We started off the day without money. Then my dad got his salary. We bought coffee, softdrinks, and KFC. Then we watched 2 *Park Chan-wook* films.

==30 - --== Watched 2 films with Chai and a bunch of TikTok vids the entire night. Oral sex in the bathroom.

==31 - 20:54== Chai went to her cousins around afternoon. Then I hyperfixated on listing downmusic genres. I feel terribly sad. Chai asked if we should take a break from our relationship.

## November

==1 - 15:28== Chai and I tried to talk it out to resolve the issue about her feeling of disconnect and wanting to take a break. We ended up on call for hours. We're okay eventually.

==2 - 6:12== I did a lot of chores today: washed dishes, cooked lunch, and bathed Cheesecake. I was watching ***Kokoro Connect*** with Japanese subtitles in between. Chai seems a bit off today, as well.

==3 - 21:54== I hyperfixated on typing down every single genre in RateYourMusic and their respective number of releases. I slept around 6:30 AM. Then I posted in my story, as well as the sample size calculator thing, which Jesse corrected me. Chai seemed off again today, too, but it was because she was jealous of Anne, who messaged me randomly saying she misses me.

==4 - --== Chai came back and brought lots of snacks.

==5 - 23:55== We didn't have money at first and I just bought instant coffee with my last money. Then me and Chai bought *kwek-kwek* and *calamares* with her money. Then groceries with my mom's money. Then dinner with my dad's money. It rained when we were going home. A lot happened.

==6 - 23:31== I watched 4 films today with Chai, the last 2 with my sister. We finished ***Fear Street*** trilogy.

==7 - 21:57== I woke up to my girlfriend crying. I comforted her half-asleep. We did nothing the entire day because we were a bit too anxious since her mom threatened to come over and wreak havoc. We had sex in the bathroom. She decided to stay for the night once more.

==8 - 21:14== I spent the day being anxious WHEN my girlfriend would go leave, so we ended up doing nothing but make out and goof around. Then when she left, her food was waiting to be delivered. But she had to take Christine to the vet, but the kitten died. I felt guilty to feel annoyance that I waited for the food to be done with but it's insensitive because she just lost a pet. I might be an asshole.

==9 - 22:25== I woke up numb and lethargic. I finished ***Kokoro Connect***. I finished composing a song for Chai. I can't form opinions properly verbally, especially in front of my girlfriend, for some reason.

==10 - --== Helped out a ton at Antipolo today with my younger brother and mother. I got 2 ecobags of books and shit for journaling that I scraped off the trash. I didn't get to talk to Chai for the entire day until I came home. I was buzzing with energy due to 2 mugs of strong coffee. I was on the call with my girlfriend until midnight. We won a quiz game. I laughed a lot, and talked a lot, and I was quick-witted. It was because I skipped my meds today. I won't sleep until tomorrow.

==11 - 22:38== I cried on call with my girlfriend because I was deeply saddened by the possibility that she'll eventually break up with me. I asked for time to compose my thoughts and so the call ended.

==12 - 23:25== I passed 3 assessments and 2 interviews virtually at Alorica. Then I headed to Quezon City to get my medical exam and for the job offer and contract signing at Alorica Centris. The 3 MoveIt rides are all free. I ate at McDo to celebrate. Chai and I are talking again.

==13 - 21:42== I woke up late. I didn't have much to do. The air is stale.

==14 - 21:27== I ignored all of Chai's calls waking me up. Then I told her not to come here. I can tell she was disappointed. I feel bad. I started watching Arcane.

==15 - --== Chai came here because I asked her to. She was a bit tipsy.

==16 - --== Chai and I watched *Arcane* season 1. Then season 2 with my sister and with her.

==17 - --== We watched ***As Gods Will*** (me, Chai and my sister). I transferred data from my iPhone 6S Pro to an iPhone SE because its battery's inflating.

==18 - 21:56== First day at the job training at Alorica. Chai went back to their house at Pinagbuhatan then I went to work through jeepney and MRT. I got there at 8:30 AM and stayed at the 7/11 until 9:00 AM. The interactions were awkward at first but by the end of our shifts, we were all laughing like hell. Our trainer is really chill and I like his accent. I got my ID. We all received ₱3000 in GCash. The commute home was hell, I ended up booking a MoveIt motortaxi. My legs were shaking from tiredness. My phone's battery is shit and its super wonky, too. It's all so tiring but I had fun, I'll admit.

==19 - 23:23== Second day of training; I made more friends. Our trainer complimented my physique. A weird nerd guy keeps talking to me. Chai seems out of it with me but she got back as friends with Toshi. I got home early. I treated my sister food.

==20 - 22:24== My birthday and my 3rd monthsary with Chai. I posted the song I made for her. Third day of training, I don't even remember half of what I learned. The class sang me a happy birthday. Ana bought me *pancit*. I ate at McDonald's twice (both cheeseburgers) and the last with my coworkers. I couldn't be with my girlfriend today. I went home sick and with menstruation. My brother bought me cake.

==21 - 22:22== The entire day is just discussing with Royce—boring because we had to sit through everything. Chai got hurt because I got disappointed that I thought we would meet at Shaw. I messaged Kenshi about the issue arising the class.

==22 - 21:58== Last day with trainers Alan and Royce, also the final assessment day. I was the first to finish in 14A. We all passed.

==23 - 21:28== Chai came to my house. We went out to buy my hygiene things and coffee. We spent our time doing nothing.

==24 - --== I went to Chai's cousins' house. We watched the last three episodes of ***From*** and some other films. We ate a lot of food that was delivered. Then we drank a lot and played Switch. It was really fun, I had so much fun with them. They all seemed nice, ignoring how they violated Chai's human rights for all her life. I want to stay for longer but I have work tomorrow.

==25 - --== I came from my girlfriend's house. First day of PST. Powerbank doesn't work. I tried the locker room vending machine coffee. Our trainer's erratic and kind of unapproachable. I kept fantasizing about me fucking my girlfriend in the bathroom.

==26 - --== I kept thinking of dirty thoughts about my girlfriend the entire day. I got the most points in the class for the day, especially the 1,000 points for finishing a chat simulation first.

==27 - --== I hate the jam-packed rush hour MRT. I had a slow day today. We did side-by-side in the production floor. I felt so dizzy and nauseous for the last 3 hours of my shift. I felt exhausted and unable to participate anymore.

==28 - --== I went to work 5 hours before my shift start. I spent my leisure time at the 20th locker floor. I felt sleepy at first but got energized near the end of dismissal. I'll continue this routine.

==29 - --== Assessment day; I passed but didn't get a 100%. Our team is falling behind. We got closer to our coaches.

==30 - --== Spent most of the day sleeping, concluding the month and building up for the next.

## December

==1 - 4:12== Chai broke up with me because she said I was too good for her and that she loves me too much that she doesn't want to hurt me any further. I've been crying for hours. This hurts like hell. I remembered the breakup—I felt numb. Life goes on. She reached out again asking to talk things out and that she misses me. I agreed but with the condition of meeting up with her to talk in person some time this week, she agreed.

==2 - --== Got back together with my girlfriend. I fumbled a lot in class but I'm embracing that I'm a fool, from head to toe. Time passed quickly when I'm having fun. I started smoking again.

==3 - --== I smoked twice. I participated a lot in class. I lost my ring at the 20th floor but found it at room 603.

==4 - --== I was out of it the entire discussions. By the end of the day, nothing's on my mind because I was so bored.

==5 - --== I wad incredibly sad and disappointed the entire day because Chai wanted to break things up with me. I think I deserve this. I still aced the assessment. People comforted me.

==6 - 6:06== We're officially done. We removed each other in our lives, just like that. I'm too numb to even feel the hurt, when I was removing her from everything. This is for the best, I can see that now. She said she hates me for that.

==7 - --== Entire day went by like a blur. All I remember was me smoking alone during lunch, eating out at Shakey's as a team, going home incredibly numb, and zoning out.

==7 - --== Got flat out drunk with my workmates. It was a fucking blast. I took care of some kid.

==8 - --== Slept at our workmate's. It was still fun in the morning. I didn't have a hangover. I went out on a friendly date with one of my coaches. I ate a lot. Chai messaged me for the last time, we had our closure.

==9 - --== Chai asked to meet up after my work shift, I agreed. The day went by too slow.

==10 - 16:53== Chai and I got back together. She slept at my house for the night. We kissed a lot. It's my dad's birthday and we ate carbonara. I fell asleep at the jeepney.

==10 - --== Colleagues congratulated me for getting back together with my girlfriend. We set up our profiles immediately. I got lots of points today.

==11 - --== Assessment day, it was easier than expected. A quick day.

==12 - --== Took chats for the very first time.

==13 - --== Took chats for almost the entire day. It was fun.

==14 - --== Girlfriend went to Centris then went with me to my house, she stayed there for a day. We were very happy.

==15 - --== Another day with my girlfriend, I love her so much.

==16 - --== Went to my girlfriend's house and drank alcohol while talking with her cousins. Chai found out about when I went to the mall with coach Madi, we got into a fight and we cried a lot. She tried to break up with me but I persisted. We eventually kind of resolved it for now. I went to work and I felt light and free because I remember that I love my girlfriend.

==17 - --== Girlfriend and I met up, she saw me off at work. I left her before she can book a motorcycle rider, she was upset and distraught and I felt really really bad I had to leave her because I was late for work. We also got into a bit of disagreement because I was mock-hurt by the fact that I couldn't make her day better for her, even though there are a lot of factors at play here and it doesn't revolve around me. I still went to work with a heavy heart. I miss her so bad the entire day.

==18 - --== Almost wanted to cry because my girlfirend is having a bad day and I felt bad for feeling bad because I made a joke that doesn't help her situation at all.

==19 - --== Pay day. I booked the AirBnB and ordered the strap-on. My girlfriend and I are okay again, she's lively today. We talked about our plans for Saturday, and we spent a lot of time talking. I've had difficulties with chats today since these are brand new cases. I'm still not satisfied with my performance.

==20 - --== Live chatting for 2 hours—it was pressuring. I wasn't confident with my results. We had an overtime of 40 minutes, paid of course. Four of us got evicted. My girlfriend and I kept having dirty talks. I ate 2 Two-Cheese Pepperonis today from 7/11. 

==21 - --== I met up with my girlfriend at Centris. We ate at Tokyo-Tokyo. We went home and slept first before we went out again. The strap-on came on time. We went to Shangrila with my sister to eat at Bonchon, I treated both of them. I bought my family Krispy Kreme half dozen. Chai and I shopped at 7/11 for the night then went back to the AirBnB. We listened to music and talked while drinking Tanduay Ice. Then we started having sex. We used the strap-on but Chai said it was too painful. She cried because I mentioned her ex again. But we tried the strap-on again and this time she said it felt amazing, the dildo vibrator strap-on was all inside her. We had multiple rounds until we got hungry at 2 AM, then we fell asleep at 3 AM.

==22 - --== Chai and I went to SM megamall to eat at a japanese restaurant. Then we took photos at a photobooth. Then we went straight to her house, with chips and water and ice cream. We drank coffee and smoked, I took a shit. We had sex again and she was very loud. We almost cried when we parted ways and kissed a lot. I went straight for work. I fucked up during this time. I showed my workmates our photobooth picture and I let them hide my hickeys on my neck that Chai put. Chai was angry and very offended. She stopped talking to me for the rest of the day.

==23 - --== I tried explaining things to Chai and I was so anxious that she'll break up with me, I had a headache. I left our photo in my locker when I was on the way home. I was almost passing out from overfatigue and hunger but I went back to the office to get the photo because I'll die if I lost it. The photo was there, I had a breakdown in the 20th floor cubicle while messaging Chai. She never replied. I was so tired and sleepy during the commute home. Chai messaged me asking me where I was and if I got home. I slept with my work clothes on and with our photo on my hand and ***Your Call*** by *Secondhand Serenade* playing in my earphones. I woke up at 5:40 PM because I didn't set my alarm because I was hoping Chai would wake me up, but she didn't. I took a MoveIt ride to work and was late for 20 minutes.

==24 - --== Chai went to my house after work. We didn't talk things out because I fell asleep, up until I woke up and she was gone.

==25 - --== Chai didn't leave any messages and I saw her tweets, something terrible happened again and it's my fault. I asked to meet up with her, she initiated a breakup again. We decided to meet eventually and talk things out—we talked things out while smoking and drinking Sting. We had sex in the bathroom.

==26 - --== Chai and I ate *Mi Goreng* as breakfast, then napped for a bit, before I went to work. Work was great, we did nothing, mostly. I spent a lot of money today.

==27 - --== I spent the day at Chai's. We drank and watched ***Squid Game***. I skipped work for her.

==28 - --== I spent the morning at Chai's. We watched ***Martyrs***. I went to get a Medical Certificate, then went to work early.

==29 - --== Last day of work. Chai and I aren't okay. I talked to Lou and Kanola about us and they're both saying we should break up. We met up, she's staying over.

==30 - --== Chai and I didn't have a talk. We spent the day cleaning our room. Her mom messaged me repeatedly.

==31 - --== New Year's Eve, Chelsea's 17th birthday. There were lots of food. I cried twice because Chai had to go home to QC. Her cousin Biyo came to get her. They borrowed the bike. I slept until 10 PM. Chai and I posted on Instagram. I sang at a Videoke. The New Year started with me and my girlfriend on call.

## May 

==2 - --== I skipped class today to go to the psychiatric hospital after months of unmedicated mess. I was prescribed 3 months of medications (which we got for free) and was advised never to stop taking them. My mom and I got home at 6 in the evening. I had a mental breakdown while I was there, I almost coulnd't stop crying because I felt useless and pathetic.

==3 - --== My family and I went to the mall with my aunts and uncle to buy stuff. I was bought new glasses but I was dizzy and sleepy althroughout because of my strong medication.

==4 - --== I talked to my LF in English to ask if I can work on my milestone and final output alone. He gave me permission. I couldn't stomach social interaction.

==5 - --== I had a one-on-one coaching session with my adviser. I asked her about the recommendation letters and she told me I just need to e-mail her, no need to create one. I was relieved.

==6 - 17:21== I can't daydream. I slept all morning and accidentally skipped morning class because I didn't wake up from my alarm clock. It's a fairly boring day, I don't feel anything, not even hunger.

==8 - 18:21== I remembered that I made a playlist that's supposedly for everyone I know to put their favorite songs in it. I should've posted that first before going away but now it's too late and I kinda feel bummed out. I still find it hard to eat. I feel a little depressed.

==9 - 14:58== It's election day. We have no classes. Mom, my brother and I went to the local elementary school to vote. There were a lot of people. I still don't have the energy to workout or do the things I'm supposed to do.

==9 - --== BBM won the elections. I feel depressed. I took 5mg of Olanzapine because the 2.5mg wasn't working enough.

==10 - 13:23== I overslept. I skipped my morning session class. I still feel depressed. Is the antidepressant even doing its job?

==11 - 10:35== I think I'm absolutely fucked. Remember when I asked my LF to give me permission to do the milestone and final output alone? Well, I'm doing it now, at least some attempts of it, but nothing is entering my brain at the moment and my presentation is due next week. I cannot focus at all, for the love of god.

==12 - 16:28== I did nothing all day but listen to music and transfer movies I've watched from Letterboxd to RateYourMusic; it's still a day well-spent. I will try to finish the ***graveyard romance*** playlist, work out a little bit and finally finish that piece I've been working on—and then work on another drawing (hopefully).

==14 - 14:40== I slept late and woke up late and I'm feeling kinda pissed and a bit lazy because I couldn't do what I was planning to do and now I don't have enough time. I don't really have concrete plans per se but still I feel bummed out. I have to record for P.E. and dump my friends later at night. I am slightly depressed.

==15 - 16:10== I finally cut my internet friends off last night. I chose not to take my evening medication and stay up all night—I'm not sure the reason why. I didn't feel like doing anything early morning. I fell asleep around noon and woke up at 3. Now I feel slightly energized, I'm going to read ***Crime & Punishment*** and later maybe watch a film. I still refuse to draw.

==16 - 13:31== I'm trying very hard to concentrate on my research but my brain is refusing to. I've made a few arguments (from a cheat source) and I've cited the sources to MLA format (also from the cheat source) but at least I got something finally. Now it's just up to me to add to that and make concrete contributions. Sir Paulo still hasn't replied to my chat or e-mail. I feel very nostalgic right now because I remember those times that my life is shit but those were the times that I've appreciated "living in the moment."

==17 - 14:39== I woke up late again but at least I (barely) attended first class. I was half asleep while logging in my attendance and I got out of the call just before my LF ended the call, which shows that I was awake (but I wasn't). At least I didn't have to try hard to put something on my USCP research. Two more arguments to go and I have two more days. I've been procrastinating so hard lately.

==18 - 15:34== I finally finished the USCP research about electoral reforms, holy shit. I was supposed to leave the conclusions for tomorrow but I might as well do it all at once so that I'll just allot tomorrow's time for preparation. I'm not 100% confident with my work but it'll do, I guess. I just want this to be over with.

==19 - 1:49== I can't sleep at all. I think I'll just stay up until later early evening. Let's just hope I can soak in some information for my presentation tomorrow. By the way, I almost fainted earlier while buying burgers.

==19 - 17:57== I couldn't review for my presentation because I was still feeling dizzy, nauseous and I'm having diarrhea. I just slept and transferred my playlists. I'll just ask to present next week. But we're going out to eat and karaoke.

==21 - 1:18== I had so much fun last night that I slept for a whole day the next day. That's the last I'm gonna see my aunt as she's going back to California. I got money and my LF still hasn't been taking notice of my messages. I'll try again next week but later I'll review my Milestone. I was planning to not sleep tonight but it's cold and I feel sleepy.

==21 - 15:18== I woke up late again when I was supposed to wake up at 9 AM to do the things I was supposed to do but my body is very stubborn.

==22 - 1:55== Highly conscious of my acne-ridden face. It doesn't seem to go away even if I wash thoroughly. Maybe the soap I'm using is finally irritating it further.

==23 - 13:34== I am not doing anything but just listening to music. I'm waiting for my LF's response, whether I'll present today or not—I don't know. I'm just on standby. Also, I made the mistake (not really) of looking at Renson's Instagram and Twitter; and as usual, he's still obsessed with my ex. Very tempted to block him on Letterboxd and on Spotify but I want to make him feel inferior lol I'm such a petty asshole.

==24 - 21:42== I'm finishing a 5-hour Filipino crime-drama film that I've been watching since 3 PM, it's pretty good. I did nothing all day but listen to music and watch a film. I put off my other plans. I also was supposed to start working out, don't know why I didn't (most likely laziness). I'll try again tomorrow. My LF still hasn't given me that recommendation letter.

==24 - 23:04== My face is still ridden with acne and it's pissing me off (also scared that I'm making it worse). But so far, my newly bought products aren't giving any signs of worsening but also of improving. We'll see in a week, I guess. I'm gonna try and stick to a skin care routine. In the morning, I'll use *Pond's Acne Clear Solutions* and *Celeteque Facial Hydration Wash*. At night, I'll still use the *Kojic-Gluta* soap but I'll pair it with the *Aloe Vera* cool gel just so it won't be dry too much. I'm also gonna try and cut coffee off my everyday diet, as well as fixing my sleep schedule—it might help.

==25 - --== I had my hair cut today, really really short. This is the first time I'm having this hair cut. I feel free. I think I will stick to shorter haircuts from now on.

==26 - 15:45== I have the laptop every Thursday when my older brother goes to work so I can do my personal research. Right now, I'm just listening to the rest of my playlist. I'm really torn whether I should schedule my vacation; I want to be consistent with my studies and art but at the same time I don't want to pressure myself. We'll just see how the remaining days of the month plays out. Anyways, I woke up feeling refreshed face-wise today. I think (hope) my skin care routine is working. I'm willing to spend a considerate amount of money for my face. By the way, my subject LF still hasn't given me any recommendation letter, I'm gonna send a follow-up message next week. If he still won't send me anything, I'll just ask the guidance for one.

==27 - 13:49== I just woke up from a quick nap. I don't know why I feel hyper aware of everything today (and a bit sleepy). Also a little depressed. I started working out yesterday.

==28 - --== My period started yesterday. I just watched films all day (and studied Japanese).

2==9 - 00:41== I'm not gonna sleep today. I feel a little depressed because I stalked Renson's Twitter account again and saw something related to Christine. I feel like shit, not because of the information but because I couldn't stop stalking accounts again and I keep finding out stuff I dread. I'm out of their lives and they're out of mine, it should be obvious for me not to care anymore.

==29 - 15:27== Lately I feel like floating away. Detached from my physical body, observing from afar. The events in my life aren't happening to me directly, I’m just a mere observer. I am not in control of anything, I am just experiencing. My decisions aren't conscious. There aren't any thoughts in my mind, no words to speak out. It all feels like a dream. 

==31 - 00:03== My family and I went to Market! Market! yesterday. I bought fiction books and notebooks for my Japanese study. I wasn't realy feeling well when I was there so I rushed my shopping a bit. Also, I found out my mom didn't really have a plan for my fully unpaid tuition fee. My dad got angry. I don't know if I'll graduate or get the scholarship for college. I don't know if I'll stop school again and just work. I have absolutely no clue what will happen next with my life. I'm trying to comfort myself by reminding myself that this too shall pass and my problems are very small compared to larger grander scheme of things. But I still feel depressed. Not sure if it's the meds. Or the coffee, milk tea and soda that made me dizzy. I don't want to talk to my friends for a while, just maybe until I figure my shit out. I've been having terrible backpains, too. My face still has acne.

## June

==2 - 16:51== I listened to 6 albums today. Most of them ***Talking Heads*** and one *Kanye West* record.

==3 - 13:27== What if I'm not meant to be stable? What if I'm meant to continue being unmedicated and eventually die young in my own flames? I've grown to hate being on meds. I'm not creative at all. It's like having erectile dysfunction but for life, not sex.

==3 - --== MJ came to our house because he said I wasn't answering his messages and then he invited me to go to Linear park. He said him and Aimee broke up just earlier. He hugged me before he went back home. I figured I'll let him stay. As for my other friends, I'll just go with whatever happens but I hope all will fade soon.

==5 - 18:07== We just got home from Antipolo where we had lunch at my aunt's house. It was nice, we just ate and watched ***Stranger Things*** Season 4. We also went to my grandma's house to get that book about EDSA People Power. The ride home was quite long.

==7 - 21:38== I had acid reflux when I woke up in the afternoon. Probably because I lied down straight after eating dinner at midnight. I postponed my biking lesson with MJ.

==9 - 16:16== I haven't slept yet because I was too excited to use the laptop that I watched 3 films after midnight. Now I have listened to 8 albums. I finished *Kanye*'s albums and then listened to some Japanese ones. I'm pretty much obsessed with Japan now. I even made a Google Docs of my plans on moving to Japan. Or maybe a month visit. I'm that committed to it.

==10 - 14:48== I slept for 15 fucking hours. I'm trying not to let it affect me because it ruined my plans. I have to workout later.

==10 - 23:37== It's crazy how much I have to let go off once I started taking something really seriously. So far, I can only manage 2 output hobbies (drawing and learning Japanese) and 2 to 3 input hobbies (films, books, music). I don't know, I feel like I'm kind of giving up guitar and writing stories and other things I want to do just to devote myself to these hobbies. Sometimes I get really annoyed that humans require sleep when I should've been doing something else during that time. Life's so short.

==13 - 4:32== I think I'm gonna make Japan a huge part of my life starting today. I've decided now. Japan feels like home.

==20 - 16:47== I've been very consistent with my Japanse studies, learning anatomy, drawing everyday, watching films and reading. I haven't worked out for quite some time now and perhaps I've given it up. I really don't have the time for it now, I have my priorities. 30th of June is growing nearer and I still haven't paid for ny tuition fee in full. I also still haven't gotten that recommendation letter from my LF, I'll go do that tomorrow. I will also start planning my 2-5 minute video for the scholarship. If worse comes to worst, I won't be able to enroll for my first semester in college and I'd have to take another gap year. Also, I have tons of things I need to buy.

==23 - 16:26== I finally finished ***Satantango*** directed by *Bela Tarr*. Dear god, that's over 7 hours and for two days that's what I watched. Was it worth it? No. Also, my subject LF still hasn't replied to me, jesus. I'm having a hangover right now because I drank one bottle of soju earlier while watching the movie.

==24 - 20:20== Mom and I went to barangay hall to get a certificate of indigency. We also went to a Korean Mart in Kapasigan to buy ingredients for the onigiri tomorrow. It's her birthday tomorrow.

==25 - --== It's my mom's birthday. We made onigiri and ate deulce-de-leche-flavored cake.

==27 - --== Renson found my sanctuary account and naturally, my art account. He followed both. I don't feel so good right now.

==28 - --== I don't know what's stopping me but I still haven't messaged miss April about the recommendation letter and record my 5-minute video presentation. I feel kind of depressed and a little bit pressured(?) like anytime I'll fall apart. Maybe I do feel depressed. I have skipped one day of olanzapine because I ran out.

==29 - 13:58== I had a short interview with miss April regarding the recommendation letter. Hopefully, I get it today. I'll record maybe tomorrow.

==30 - 17:06== I haven't received my report card today therefore I wouldn't be able to apply for a scholarship, I still haven't recorded yet. I tried doing a video diary earlier about my research on 2022 presidential candidates, I'll edit it later. My back shoulder hurts. I'm starting to feel being manic again, I haven't taken Olanzapine for 3 days and I won't be taking one tonight. Gods have mercy.

## July

==4 - 19:24== It's been four days late and I still haven't applied for that scholarship. I think I'm starting to accept the fact that I won't be getting into college this year even though I could've. I'm not gonna blame anyone, I guess that's just my life now. Also, I'm starting to feel myself become manic and also becoming addicted to the almost euphoric and transcendental high that I don't think I want to take any medication from now on. I hate being medicated. I'm more creative and superbly aware of everything now more than ever.

==5 - 22:10== My mind is starting to border hyperdrive once more. I watched a really good documentary about bipolarity and I typed a really really long review on letterboxd detailing what my episodes are like and it took me 5 hours to finish the documentary. Also, in the middle of it, at 3 AM, my parents and I went to the newly opened McDonald's and ate cheeseburgers and apple pie. I also had some nice vanilla coffee. I doodled a lot today and my mind is so active I think I can doodle forever but my body says I should work out right now. I don't ever want to be medicated.

==7 - 13:12== My mind is so tired but at the same time it's the most active than ever. My eyes hurt, my brain is on fire, I've been sleeping for only 2 hours. My sketches in bipolar reddit gained attention and I met some people and it's kind of overwhelming even though it's not much. I feel like I can do anything and everything but I don't have the attention and focus for it. It's weird, I can't be productive but I feel so active. My eyes are constantly wide for some reason. I need sleep but I'm not tired.

==8 - 17:47== I slept for 16 hours, on and off.

==9 - 12:35== I'm not depressed or suicidal right now, in fact I feel so fantastic I could do anything and never sleep nor eat. But I can't help but think about living with my illness for the rest of my life and being unable to function normally as a citizen of this society. I feel like I don't have a future and I refuse to live in a world tormented like this. I feel so hopeless and victimized but I'm not depressed. Is this a mixed episode? I suddenly have a terrible terrible urge to buy 80 notebooks on Shopee because I want to write down every single song on every single one of my 100+ playlists because I'm anxious that Spotify will go away someday and I will never have access to my songs again. I don't have the money yet but I figured I'll just buy 10 for now (if I get my money). I'd trade my medication money for notebooks.

==10 - 12:32== I don't know why the idea of me possibly being autistic came up again today, probably because I just realized that a long time obsession of mine is hoarding, categorizing, listing and organizing music—everything music, and lists, have been a long standing interest, almost neverending dedication. I can devote my whole life to just making lists and hoarding music and I'll die happily. That's when I realize "fuck, this might actually be a special interest" so I made a list (ha) of why I think and I don't think I have autism. Tomorrow, we'll go to the mental hospital again to see my psychiatrist and get prescription meds, I'll just show them the list and we'll see. Wish me luck (hope I don't have it) but I also hope I can understand myself better.

==11 - 15:15== Just got home from the psychiatric hospital again with my mom and my sister. This time I was mostly on my own. I was too hyper today that I know my sister was getting annoyed. The psychiatrist just basically confirmed that I'm manic (as if I don't already know) and said I should continue medication (even though I hate it so much). If I'm still manic with Olanzapine then I'll change antipsychotics. I also asked to get further assessed if I have autism, the psychiatric looked at me straight in the eye and firmly said "no, you don't have autism, you don't show symptoms of it." so I was like "yeah sure whatever" I was too manic to feel invalidated even though I haven't even shown them the extensive list I made on why I think and don't think I have autism. I mean, I'm glad I don't then but even if I do, it's probably very very mild and not a hindrance to my everyday life (unless). I was vlogging the whole time I was waiting for my mom and my sister, I talked to myself—I was bored and too energetic with nothing better to do. I told my psychiatrist I wanted to be like Van Gogh; to die young and create amazing artworks while unmedicated. The psychiatrist just nodded, they probably thought it was just manic idealizations (most likely is) and I'm too manic again to feel the slightest bit of regret and embarrassment right now. Guess I'd have to take meds again....

==12 - 23:44== I've been sleeping for more than 24 hours. My brain feels like a huge foggy mess of a puddle after drinking antispsychotics once again. I hate this. I skipped everything I had to do.

==13 - 22:16== I keep passing out/waking up every 2 hours. Haven't done anything productive today, I still don't feel good. I've only been watching films.

==14 - 16:29== Feelin' a lil' depressed and out of touch with reality, on the verge of crying, head empty.

==19 - --== I studied Japanese for 8 hours straight without breaks. My hand is tired. I wanted to draw, too, but the time just doesn't seem right.

==22 - 2:35== I decided not to sleep (and also not take my antipsychotic) for the night. I'm definitely manic and I almost feel like a clown. I've also decided to make my "*monoquin*" account (yes, i'm still calling it that) a huge archive of everything i ever consume that are worth noting. I even posted a message on my instagram story for my followers saying what my account will turn into—an absolute crazy mess of an archive. But it's MY archive! I'm excited to edit and stuff. This is my treasure trove, my sanctuary, my love of my life and my everything. I will pour my heart and my soul to running this account (and my spotify). Anyways, I'm still manic and Jhanna still hasn't responded to any of my messages.

==22 - 7:58== Five hours has passed, one mug of coffee down, a little chat with a redditor, a barrage of messages to my best friend, a bunch of edited post for my personal archive instagram, four kanji practices and one reddit post later—my brain is already starting to implode on itself. I'm so fucked but I'm so fucking happy. I'll update this again later and see how I progress; like a little science experiment that I'll be—being hypomanic on coffee and second day of menstruation.

==28 - 11:56== I haven't slept for almost a day and nothing that I study is entering my head. Also, I've recently given up on a daily routine—that shit can fuck right over, I'll do whatever I want whenever I want however I want (it's still frustrating though that I can't seem to focus on studying). A mod on discord messaged me earlier saying my Spotify account was awesome, I was paralyzed by social anxiety, my instincts tell me to run away and never come back.

==30 - 1:52== I don't know why I feel sad and unmotivated even though there's plenty of things I want to do. Should I try to snap out of this soon or just let it be?

## August

==1 - 18:07== I've been sleeping a lot and my tooth has been aching since yesterday. I hate it. I just finished *Vsauce*'s ***Mind Fields*** though, that's something. I still don't feel like doing anything. I took a shower today. I've been obsessed with MBTI lately, too.

==2 - 3:27== The left side of my face is aching. I almost fainted earlier. Why do I feel so miserable?

==2 - 23:29== I feel so miserable and I don't want to do anything.

==3 - 22:47== I feel like shit. I've been sleeping a ton and it's such a drag to get up and do things. Days are night and nights are days—I've lost all sense of time. I don't know how long I've been this way but it feels like weeks. The most energy I can muster up to do something is watch Youtube. It feels like I have a terrible fever but in the head. I dreamt of Renson and Christine again today, this time my brain painted Renson as a close friend; we went out to hang out and even planned future hangouts just the two of us.

==3 - 23:44== I started watching ***Game of Thrones***. It's incredibly fast-paced compared to the book.

==4 - 15:59== I just finished my research about Philippine History (although not much in-depth because I grew lazy). But I'll research more about Martial Law and read books about it. Right now, I want to learn Math and Science (kind of in preparation for next year's college entrance exams as well as my self interest). Can't wait! I'm surprised though today that I had the attention span to actually study compared to the past several Thursdays. Maybe it's because of ***Game of Thrones***?

==4 - 22:45== I learned ***Safe and Sound*** by *Taylor Swift* on the guitar in between reading ***Game of Thrones***. I spend my days mostly either sleeping or staring off into space.

==5 - 17:02== I just woke up. It's raining. I'm losing all sense of time, I thought it was morning.

==6 - 5:07== I finished ***Game of Thrones*** today, both the book and the series (season 1 only). I don't think I can go through with the rest even though it's epic—in my opinion, the book is still infinitely better. Yet knowing that it still yet to have a conclusion, I'm not gonna go through with the book series either. Anyways, it's my graduation later. Surprised my name is on the completer's list (considering my mom still hasn't paid for my tuition fully). Not sure what will happen or if I'll attend the event.

==7 - 12:26== I feel a bit dizzy and sick right now. I had a weird dream last night. I was at this event with IC and there were a group of girls on a table in front of us. The host was playing K-pop and I said a witty remark about collabs and the girls laughed. Apparently, I was just there to register or something. The girls wrote their names on a paper along with their respective phone numbers and gave it to me (because they found me cute). We all hang out after the event. I was wearing a sleeveless top and shorts, and I was carrying a cup of coffee and a flask of whiskey. All the girls had the hots for me and was like trying to level up in sort of a dating simulation. I relished in their attention. I feel like such a cool person in my dream, the confidence was overflowing. I also had an instagram account in my dream where I put on my story a photo of the paper the girls gave me.

==8 - 3:01== I unfollowed Renson on Letterboxd and Spotify. I don't even know why I still followed him until now. Glad I did unfollow though. I have to let go of old baggages and stop stalking his and Christine's accounts. I'm done. I'm ready to totally move on and forget about everything that's ever happened.

==8 - 21:38== I slept for 16 hours. I had a very long dream. I feel confused and sluggish. I don't feel like doing anything.

==11 - 17:31== Went to get a booster shot with my family only to find out I'm not yet due for a booster so I ended up going home (which was what I planned all along). It's weird, my days seem longer and I have more time than I could ever ask for.

==12 - 16:14== Here we are again with I don't feel like doing anything. I woke up late so maybe that's the reason. My dreams always consist of a girl wanting me—am I lonely and just weirdly ignorant of it?

==13 - 17:16== I'm watching ***Shakugan no Shana*** right now; one of my favorite animes when I was a kid. Although, it doesn't really hold up to my expectations. It's a typical anime kind of anime (if that makes sense). I also just recently discovered a neat little trick regarding my art account. I will just make it seem like I'm still that kid in *Mabanta* compound with my small hyperfixations without a worry about the outside world. I feel better in that perspective and it suits my situation very well. It also makes me unafraid to try new things and put my ideas onto paper.

==15 - 13:26== I'm having a terrible bout of anxiety right now. I just read on Reddit that tooth abscess, when left untreated for months, can lead to death. I have mine for almost half a year. I think I'll die. I'll tell my mom later to get my tooth extracted.

==16 - 12:03== I don't feel like doing anything, at all. I don't know why. I just want to sleep all day or do something that doesn't require much energy at least.

==17 - 19:48== Thank god we have coffee again. I don't think I can continue on without it. I have acne again (on my chin). Also, I finished the album cover art for that Redditor, I'll send it to them once they replied to my message. Hope they like it (so I won't have to do it again). I can't draw these days.

==18 - 18:35== I started studying math (the very basic ones). I started from the very beginning, that's how I like to do it. I'm determined to dedicate my entire year to only studying. This boosted me to finally do the things I've been putting off. I will take my time studying and also enjoy the process. I should also start thinking of my next art piece soon.

==23 - 3:30== I can't sleep. I feel sleepy but I can't sleep. I'm just watching ***Adventure Time*** to.. pass the time (ha).

==24 - 2:21== Yesterday, I literally only just spent the whole day hyperfocusing on taking pictures of all my drawings I ever did in my entire life, and I planned to post it on my instagram story one drawing a day. I'm gonna make it so chaotic. I think I'm becoming hypomanic again haha.

==25 - 20:39== I have been adding journaling shit to my shopee cart since morning. I barely slept since yesterday and I'm feeling very impulsive. Might fuck around and check out everything with money I don't have.

==26 - 2:16== I had tremors while watching ***Saving Private Ryan***. I can't sleep for the life of me. The redditor whom I sent the drawing to is still not responding. I can't fucking sleep.

==27 - 3:10== I did a lot yesterday despite me waking up at 4 in the afternoon. I studied Math, practiced Kanji, did anatomy exercises and did a simple art piece. I just finished watching a film right now, it's ***10 Cloverfield Lane***. It was good. I still feel a bit hypomanic and my sleep schedule's all fucked but I don't really care. I have approximately 369 days to kill time before I start school. Routines, schedules and consistency can fuck right over, I will do whatever I want starting today and I will take my time doing so.

==27 - 7:50== My brain is imploding in on itself, I still haven't slept. Shouldn't've probably drank that strong coffee. I posted on r/ArtistLounge on how it's very hard for me to focus on details because my brain is impatient. A lot has been speculating I have ADHD. I'm not really sure, it's probably just the hypomania.

==29 - 1:44== I've just been watching Twice on Youtube, reading Twice fanfiction and daydreaming for the past three days. I also haven't been showering everyday, just every 2 to 3 days. But I'm not depressed, I feel energetic actually. But I can't do the things I want to do for some reason. Like something's stopping me. I keep chasing that high I get from my fixations that I can't quit. I'm procrastinating so hard, I even skipped on so much of my chores. I haven't done my laundry, too. We went to my nephews' birthday party today at McDonald's. I actually had fun because I'm a bit hypomanic and totally not-shy. Something inside me feels terribly wrong again (whenever I socialize) and I feel so bad but I keep talking. I realized something big today about myself that I should probably go write on my journal to not forget about it. It's about how much I hate myself.

==30 - 10:23== I haven't slept still. I've just been watching Twice. My brain is imploding. I have to stay awake to wait for the Shopee delivery. My plans are kind of ruined now. I didn't do laundry, I didn't wash dishes, I didn't fucking sleep BECAUSE I CAN'T. I'M GONNA FUCKING DIE

## September

==1 - 14:34== Still can't do shit. I received the Rubik's cube today though.  Everything is such a drag. I still only watch Twice and read fanfiction, can't do shit at all. Can't even listen to music. I can sleep better now though.

==3 - 8:34== I have been solving and learning the rubik's cube since I got the cube on September 1. First, I learned the beginner method and doing that quickly got me over 1 minute of solving time. Now, I finished learning F2L, currently familiarizing OLL and starting to learn PLL. It will take days of practice to fully master the algorithms and drop my solving time but I'll take my time (lol). Also, I'm starting to try and get shit done and pull my shit together by listening to music once again. I know it's terrible when I can't listen to music but now I'm starting to warm up to it more and soon, my other hobbies. Currently, I'm really addicted to cubing and TWICE. I miss SNSD (even though they're active now) and it made me realize that TWICE really can't come close to SNSD's greatness, at all. They're completely different. Also, I realized I've kinda fallen in love with Myoui Mina and I sorta can't accept if ever she's officially dating someone, it'll hurt me. I broke my 5-day streak of not checking my Spotify followers because I wanted to see if a certain someone noticed my new bio. I think I'll post on my story on Septemver 5.

==5 - 17:11== Just got home from the mental health center for another check-up. I'm tired of coming here and having to deal with my illness. I want to be a normal person. I haven't slept yet so I'm waiting until 6 PM so I can drink meds. They upped my dosage, both for antidepressants and antipsychotics, because I keep getting more unstable as time goes by. I shared my Spotify on my Instagram and I got some messages I've yet to open—I don't know why I'm avoiding it. Also, I updated my art account for the first time after more than a week of hiatus. I feel so terrible right now.

==8 - 13:06== I slept for 18 hours. I still didn't get the chance to continue studying or learning Japanese but I'm getting there. I managed to finish ***Kafka on the Shore*** by *Haruki Murakami* yesterday. It was a great book and it was such an achievement that I finished it. I think I'll study tomorrow, I really want to get back on my hobbies because I can't be kind to myself for too long. My mind and body feels so heavy.

==9 - 23:11== I feel so empty but I did stuff today. Finished that commission art from a Redditor, managed to study one math topic and learn to write 5 kanji characters. I also made a quick drawing of what I feel. I want to do more but I just don't have the energy. I was supposed to watch a film but I can't find links online of what I want to watch so I just skipped them for now. I still haven't done my laundry... maybe tomorrow.

==10 - 20:13== I finally did my laundry today, it took us hours (I was with my sister). After that, I just don't have the energy to do anything, even now. I feel like this day just isn't it. I slept for a few hours this afternoon and when I woke up, the same feeling of not wanting to do anything is present. Even if I drank coffee, I just want to sleep. But I studied a little (finished one topic) and listened to an album today. Maybe tomorrow it'll be easier.

==11 - 17:36== I slept for 15 hours. I haven't done anything today, I just woke up. I feel very disconnected from reality and devoid of any feelings.

==12 - 16:25== I'm in a creative slump, my head's just completely blank. I don't have the drive to create anything, it's frustrating.

==12 - 21:11== I ran out of things to do, I'm at a standstill. I finished *Lucifer Valentine*'s ***Vomit Gore*** trilogy. I feel unreal.

==13 - 00:27== I finished a lot today even though I woke up late. I continued anatomy (finally), watched a film, practiced my Kanji, studied math, watched ***Adventure Time***, read a book (***The Diary of a Young Girl***), listened to music—I'm listening to an album right now before I sleep. That's a lot, no? I'm slowly finding my pace now.

==14 - 18:58== Took a nap for 4 hours, making up the lost time I didn't get to sleep earlier. I sacrificed reading time for it though. I went out to buy my mom medicine for her toothache. I deleted my ***downtempo mellow shot*** playlist because I didn't really vibe with it. Jhanna still hasn't replied to my messages, her birthday is in two days.

==14 - 21:59== I *studied* 3 math topics today—I'm on a roll! I even forgot to eat today. I feel hungry now but I'm too lazy to go downstairs.. maybe later. Tomorrow I'll study code and listen to *Takuto*'s discography.

==15 - 18:14== I studied HTML and CSS today—I had so much fun! HTML was so much easier than I last studied it. Back then, I would write down every single information about it, but now I just kind of breezed through them, and I still learned. I even made my own website (just a form-type of website) with little to no modifications. I'll get there. But I don't think I'll even pursue Web Design, I'll go through Computer Science, I think, and that uses different programming languages. Jhanna finally replied to my messages.

==17 - 23:46== I woke up really late today, around quarter to 3 in the afternoon. I only managed to study Japanese, read and study math today. I finished the 4th grade topics. For sure, I'll sleep late later (I'm drinking coffee).

==19 - 1:28== I didn't sleep yesterday but managed to take a nap in the afternoon. I suddenly have a feeling of contentment and a feeling free of worry and insecurity, like I'm just doing my thing, no need to let people ruin it for me. Like, who cares who's watching? Who cares if there isn't anyone who is? I'm still gonna do my shit regardless, anyways.

==19 - 8:26== I haven't slept yet. I find it a bit funny that because I have too many interests, instead of focusing on one, I just said "fuck it" and do everything at once. And no, I'm not hypomanic right now (at least I think so). I haven't been sleeping well, I'm reviewing my Japanese exercises right now. I feel slightly sleepy.

*==19 - 23:35==* I fell asleep around 12 noon earlier, slept for 6 hours, at most. My sister's friends came to our room and they drank a lot of alcohol without my parents knowing (though I doubt that). I was overwhelmed and was anxious that they'd puke everywhere. They made such a mess of my bed after I let them on it. I had to clean up their trash and change my sheets. One girl's beanie got mixed up with mine so my sister will get it from another girl tomorrow. I don't think I'll act like that drunk nor do I want to be drunk ever—it's such a wasteful pointless feeling. I was studying math when they came, I think I'll study some more.

==23 - 1:59== I studied code yesterday but just for a short while because my brain's kinda not working in the morning and I can't take in too much information. Adding paddings, borders and margins are kinda complicated in CSS. And I haven't really slept properly that time so my mind's a bit foggy. I did make a website about Twice though for coding practice. I like how it turned out. I can make adjustments in the future as I learn more. I fell asleep around 6 while listening to my playlist and woke up at half past 9. I also arranged my playlists on my profile and created 2 new accounts to follow my own account (lol). I will make more accounts in the future just so my follower count never reaches below 100. I studied one topic in math and one topic in science because ratio was a bit harder than I thought. My sister and I talked a bit about us moving houses again next year and hoping it's a decent house—even more decent than this one. We're also hoping that my mom finishes paying for my tuition and for my older brother to finish paying for his laptop so my sister can finally buy a new phone. I'll wake up at 9 AM later.

==24 - 4:22== Listening to *Mitski*'s discography right now. I slept for 15 hours yesterday, I barely even studied. I'll make up for it today.

==26 - 00:27== I slept for more than 15 hours yesterday....

==27 - 20:46== I woke up extra early today and didn't feel the urge to fall back asleep. I finally finished both *Genki* 1 textbook and workbook. I studied math and science fairly quick, too. I'll try and finish reading ***Flowers in the Attic*** tonight, I'm almost done now anyways. I have finished two saved Spotify playlists, too; ***1930's-1940's Japanese WW2 Music*** and ***mga poging tambay sa bgc soundtrip***.

==29 - 21:43== I woke up extra early today (because I forgot to drink my meds). I studied HTML and CSS again, I kinda wanted to try other resources to further familiarize myself. Today, I tried "The Odin Project" and "FreeCodeCamp." I had a bit of trouble adjusting my TWICE website. I am now dead set on pursuing a Computer Science degree and getting a decent scholarship. Hopefully, this time, the odds are in my favor.  I found out in DOST scholarship, if not a STEM student, I'd have to be among the top 5% of the graduating class. There's also an exam on March for the scholarship. I thought I lost motivation to study because there isn't PUPCET but now I regained more drive because of DOST. I'm gonna get that scholarship, just you wait.

==30 - 17:08== Last day of the month, feeling extra motivated. I did the laundry and took the mock DOST Scholarship exam. I got 115 out of 203 correct. It was so difficult! Like UPCAT. It has logical reasoning, too. I feel inspired to start my next month, October. I'll study the hell out of this 160 days. I hope I get the scholarship. If I don't then that's still okay. It only means it isn't for me.

==30 - 21:44== We ate KFC today. My brother bought a Nintendo Switch. I'm taking a break from studying because my back hurts. I have to start stretching more often, my back is killing me. I thought it was Saturday today.

## October

==2 - 00:09== I found out I received approximately 2,600 pesos from the Redditor who commissioned me. Jesus Christ, I was surprised with how large the amount was. Although, I can't use it yet because the funds are on hold for up to 21 days because my account is new. By next month maybe I can cash it out.

==2 - 4:02== I can't fucking sleep, no matter how hard I try. I keep thinking about what I'll do later, eating pizza and telling my mom the good news. I know I'll regret not sleeping but what can I do? I just can't sleep. Great way to start off the month, huh?

==2 - 16:47== I didn't sleep—I only am about to sleep right now. A lot has happened today. I already told you about the commission money on Paypal. There's a possibility that I might have a new phone pretty soon (just a possibility) and we ate at Yellow Cab today (my brother's treat). We went to shop at PureGold but I was feeling sick so I had to go home immediately. I played ***Pokemon Unite*** on my brother's Nintendo Switch a little bit when we got home and practiced Kanji on a newly bought Math notebook with graphing paper as pages. It's safe to say this was a fairly wonderful day and I hope this energy continues. Tomorrow I'll go see my psychiatrist. Life is good.

==3 - 20:59== I woke up 4 in the morning today because my mom and I went to NCMH. We also left NCMH early because the process was smooth since we were early. I felt sleepy and a bit dizzy. I have been suspecting I might have agoraphobia—the fear of being in situations where there won't be an escape or any help. I feel myself getting sick and dizzy thinking about possibly going sick and dizzy. When we got home, it was drizzling outside, I felt lazy to do anything so I just listened to an album and fell asleep in the middle of it. I just started studying around 3. Oh, did I mention my psychiatrist upped my dosage (again) in antipsychotics from 5mg to 10mg a night. Guess we'll just have to fuck around and find out.

==4 - 20:07== I passed out and slept for a whole day after taking the 10mg of Olanzapine. I didn't study today. I took them again earlier now I feel sleepy again.

==5 - 20:13== I finally got my dad's iPhone 6s plus—transferred my data and all that. But the battery health is very low so I have to be cautious. I have 16 more days left to get my money to replace the battery. I'm not really sure if I'd have this permanently because my dad and my uncle still haven't settled the "new phone" dilemma. I hope they leave me out of it.

==6 - 20:31== I went back to Codecademy for JavaScript. The Odin Project had a lot of shenanigans before diving into the actual study of the language. Codecademy makes me put more into practice even if it's a bit handed to me on a silver platter. Coding is kinda hard—and I'm just starting. I look forward to more coding in the future.

==7 - 20:59== I finally started working out again except I only worked out for about 13 minutes and then stopped because I was feeling dizzy and shaking like crazy. I did a lot today though, which is nice.

==9 - 00:57== I borrowed my brother's laptop because he's not home until later today. I re-learned The Odin Project and decided to just stick with it, I'm abandoning Codecademy. I learned how to use Git and committing to GitHub. My sister and I played COD mobile until 12 midnight and then we went outside to buy hotdogs and burgers at Angel's burger (with her money). I can't sleep.

==9 - 20:53== I slept for 18 hours today, I didn't get to do anything. I just listened to music, played videogames and now about to watch a film. Louise unfriended me on COD mobile. I mean, she has every right to and I know there's a reason for it but I can't help but feel bad—I deserve this for ditching them. I dreamt of them and CJ earlier. I dreamt I came back (awkwardly) and we kinda had a sleepover (also that I went to Bulacan again). I probably just miss them. I still feel bad for what I've done but I can't take any of that back, I just have to live through it. I also feel bad after my recent conversation with Jhanna and how kinda I disagreed with her on the context of her decision to not tell her parents if ever she's diagnosed. I don't know, I just think it's really pointless and I tried to come across as nonchalant and still understanding but I feel I might've hit a nerve and come off as insensitive and invalidating instead. She hasn't responded yet. I really hope she gets better soon, I hate seeing her so low.

==10 - 17:08== I finally completed one full work-out (40 minutes) without passing out. I still felt a bit nauseous and was shaking uncontrollably but I managed to finish a whole set. I was motivated by my mom's gift for me; a 1kg dumbbell. My parents forbid me to use the 2kg one, saying I should start with the small one first. I just gave up trying to relent. It's a pretty slow day. I also finished that one artwork where there are alien worms inside the astronaut's suit (in charcoal). I also listened to two podcast episodes.

==10 - 22:19== Woof. I had an extremely hard time with rational numbers word problems on Khan Academy. It took all my energy that I didn't have the strength to study one Science topic. I'll push harder tomorrow. For now, I'll rest.

==12 - 1:26== I kept falling asleep yesterday throughout the day and now I can't sleep. This will ruin my sleeping schedule again...

==12 - 17:36== I fell asleep around 4 AM earlier and I woke up 12 hours later. I didn't work out today (because I didn't get the chance to eat lunch) and my mom, again, couldn't get my meds because she forgot my patient's ID (she forgot my ID last time, too) which sucks, I feel bad for her. She'll get it on Monday, I still have meds left anyways. I feel bummed out again because I couldn't do the things I had to do because I woke up late.

==12 - 22:16== Math in Khan Academy is progressively getting more difficult as time goes by. It's taking me longer hours of studying to finish one topic compared to my first few weeks. Science is keeping up, too. At this rate, I will run out of time not covering everything I have to study. I'm not really sure if I can apply in DOST considering my mom still haven't paid for my tuition fully to be able to get my report card and diploma. Maybe I should just let it be and try to learn in my own pace instead of rushing in all at once, maybe it'll become easier that way. Also, I dreamt of being in a Math club in school which has multiple talented genius kids who are infinitely better than me in solving. The club is very high-tech-y and the games are very interactive and exciting. I felt excited in my dream, actually, feels like I'm part of a group or competing with a bunch of nerds.

==14 - 00:31== I woke up 11 AM yesterday and I immediately went and study code. Today, I learned about the box model and how to manipulate a flexbox. It's a bit complicated and I feel guilty for just copying the solution codes when I wanted to give up (which is fairly quick). I'll never learn this way if I keep it up. I also skipped my workout AGAIN, I just don't feel like it. Next month, my sister will start school face-to-face so I'll be alone in my room more, I can use that opportunity to workout consistently.

==14 - 21:10== I woke up 6 PM.... I didn't do shit and I don't feel like studying either so I just watched a film and going to just listen to albums all night long. I'm planning on not sleeping so I can reset my sleep sched again. I'm still gonna drink my night meds though. Just gonna drink lotsa coffee to stay awake.

==15 - 14:59== Sike, I didn't stay up to reset my sleep schedule. I fell asleep around past 4 AM. Fuck this shit.

==15 - 22:58== I only studied a little bit of Science today, that's all my little brain can manage for now. For some reason, I just want to keep listening to albums, so that's what I'm doing now. I can't do anything but listen to albums. I also studied a bit of Japanese earlier and drew something on digital. Tomorrow is CJ's birthday. Not that I care or anything, it's just saved on my calendar.

==16 - 7:26== Fuck, I think I'm depressed.

==16 - 10:18== I'm bored, I don't feel real, I'm paralyzed, I can't do anything, I don't want to do anything, but I feel like I have to do something—but what? My endless list of hobbies and none interests me. I need to photocopy some document later, I feel hungry. I still haven't slept yet, I want to sleep. Not because I'm sleepy but because I'm bored. I've been scrolling through Reddit on and off, even posted twice on Bipolar subreddit. I need a reset. My period hasn't come yet. Is that the right grammar. Fuck, I need (want) to study but my body just refuses to. I can't even watch a film. Everything's such a drag. I don't feel like a real person.

==19 - 2:37== I woke up in the middle of the night and can't seem to fall back asleep. I did a lot yesterday, checked off all of my daily to-do list (yay), well, except for workout. I plan on working out next month when my sister has classes so I can have the room to myself. So, it turnd out I wasn't actually depressed, I just have my period.

==20 - 11:50== I pretty confidently deleted at least a thousand images in my iCloud, believing the photos in my device won't be deleted. Boy, how wrong I was. It just donned on me now that it actually did get deleted in my device, and now I lost about a thousand images. Fuck me, right? This is what I get for deleting stuff. I should've deactivated the sync settings on my phone first before permanently deleting them. Now, I lost some of my monoquin and art account to-post stuff (I have to re-take the pictures and do the edits again ughhh), my selfies (not that they're important, I still have my face, right?), a bunch of art inspos, and some art and memes I made (that I'll never get back). Fuck. I think I also deleted videos of dance man from Reddit, fuck. Guess we're leaving all that behind and start anew, huh? Jeez...

==20 - 19:17== I finally started transferring my Spotify playlists to an outside Spotify app (or website) and I decided to list everything on Notion. I already finished transferring 5 playlists but we'll see how it'll go if I have to switch to Google Sheets or something.

==20 - 23:42== Last second decision, I think I'll just let my Spotify playlists be. I'd rather spend all that time transferring my 200 playlists listening to new music than jot down everything manually—that'll probably take me years. I still need a life, y'know. So, this is a last second decision—I won't be transferring my playlists anymore. Spotify be fucked.

==20 - 23:53== Wait, holy shit, I just had an epiphany. I found one single ultimate purpose why I'll be pursuing Computer Science in college. I want to create a program that will duplicate all my Spotify playlists in a server and will continuously update everytime I add songs on the playlists. In that way, I won't have to manually enter the songs in each lists. Plus if Spotify ends up gone, I'd still have my duplicated playlists. Holy fucking shit, I'm so pumped to study and create that program.

==22 - 21:22== Today I fucked up by buying two packs of coffee instead of just one. The store didn't have a price scanner so my sister and I had to know the price as we're buying. I thought the price would be just low, turns out it wasn't—my mistake was that I didn't put it back. My anxiety prevented me from doing so. My sister had to pay for the extra price. I feel awful because my mom seemed irritated. Also, I saw Jhanna's instagram stories and it seems like she's doing well. She's clearly ignoring me and I feel awful about that, too. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day. I received the pending cash on PayPal but there's still no way I can get the cash because my dad's PayPal is also on hold.

==24 - 22:00== My parents and I went hunting for government IDs at *Kapitolyo*. I felt kind of off and irritated because of the heat but we managed to get a PhilHealth ID amidst everything. We also got to apply for National ID. It was very tiring, we got home by 3 PM but I still managed to study around 5 PM until past 8. I finally have a valid ID. I just need a 1x1 photo and we're done. I can now get my Gcash verified.

==26 - 23:40== Jhanna and I finally made up last night. We're okay now. She apologized, I apologized. Although it might take time to remove the awkwardness from not speaking for 2 weeks let off. I can't wait to have my GCash verified.

==29 - 1:00== I finally have my GCash verified using my PhilHealth ID. I cashed in my money from PayPal to GCash. I bought things for my younger sister. I'm contemplating whether to use my money for stuff I don't need on 11.11 free shipping discount on Shopee. I don't really have anything I want to buy right now on my cart. I can't sleep.

==29 - 20:57== I woke up late again (as usual). This increase dosage of Olanzapine is proving to be very annoying and inconvenient with my sleep schedule. I need to tell my psychiatrist about this.

==30 - 21:02== My family on my mother's side went to visit my grandfather's grave today then we went at a resort. It was so tiring. I had to socialize for most of the time, it's so awkward. All I wanted was to go home and study. Beer tastes like shit, I don't ever want to drink that again. I think I've actually become agoraphobic, I should tell my psychiatrist about it. Also about my social anxiety....

==31 - 20:58== I swear to god if I woke up late again tomorrow. I really don't have discipline, do I? The meds are also to blame but geez, I can't control myself from falling back asleep. I really need to work on that if I'm gonna take college seriously. Hopefully this time, tomorrow, I'll finally wake up early. First thing I'll be doing is buy coffee.

## November

==1 - 21:12== I woke up late again but I didn't go to the laundry today because it's closed. I worked out for 18 minutes. It's a slow day (I think).

==3 - 21:36== Learned some JavaScript today—basic ones and I'm already kinda drained. Why is it I can't focus much when I'm supposed to? Anyways, afterwards I just tried to do other stuff other than study. I feel like the timing isn't right. I didn't work out today either. Maybe tomorrow will be better.

==4 - 21:28== I woke up at 2 PM. Didn't get the chance to study Japanese nor draw or listen to an album or watch a film... I did a full workout though and studied for about eight 30/5 pomodoros. I plan on making up for lost time tomorrow. I swear on my life I'll wake up extra early.

==5 - 20:40== I slept late, around 4 AM, and woke up almost 3 PM. I got the chance to watch a film (a rather shitty one) and listen to a *Titus Andronicus* album before I sleep. Although, I didn't have the chance nor energy to study Japanese or draw. Tomorrow is my rest day, I plan on watching films, series, and listening to albums all day. Maybe throw in some time for book reading. Whatever I feel like doing.

==6 - 21:45== Sunday is my rest day. I didn't do anything all day but sleep, listen to music and watch a film. I'm thinking of being more proactive in articulating my thoughts after consuming media—whatever form it may be. I was thinking I'll buy a separate notebook but I think I'll just write them down on my journal. I mean, it has the same purpose. We're going to NCMH tomorrow for my usual check-up. I think I won't sleep tonight.

==7 - 13:48== Kinda pissed. We didn't get to go to NCMH because my mom and I woke up late. Then I woke up even later (around 12 PM) so I didn't have the chance to study Japanese or draw. I have time now actually but I don't feel like doing anything, which sucks. I still have to drink 10mg of Olanzapine which means I'm still going to wake up late.

==7 - 16:42== I don't feel like doing anything today. But I plan on not sleeping until tomorrow to catch up on my studies or the shit I have to do. Let's do this.

==8 - 8:29== Hey. I didn't sleep (and I kind of regret it). I said I'll catch up on stuff (and I did the rough sketch for the Reddit commission) but I just can't bring myself to focus at all. It feels like the timing isn't right, I'm out of my routine. It's 8 in the morning with nothing to do. I have to keep awake until 6 later tonight before I can sleep. I can't workout either today. My self-discipline is way out of line, I know. I'm not giving up fully on working out, at least not yet. I'll try to work out tomorrow and do 12 pomodoros. I have 9 hours to kill, I don't know what to do.

==9 - 23:38== My mom didn't get her salary yesterday so we're short on money. Good thing me and my older brother have money to spare for electricity bill and food. I hope these 11 days go by quickly.

==10 - 20:05== I studied (continued) Javascript around 12 noon because I was rewriting my notes. During studying, I can feel my brain imploding on itself as it tries to soak in the hard raw information on how to debug Javascript code and use breakpoints or some shit. I know I can learn this but my brain is trying its best to procrastinate. I didn't do much learning done during the last 8 hours, I figured I'd have to incorporate code into my everyday life now. Like seriously. If I have to take myself seriously, I can't just go on learning once a week (every Thursdays). I need to do this every day. Writing down notes can sometimes be a waste of time and can put importance on things that aren't really that important so I will try to tone things down in the note-taking department. Instead, I'll practice.

==11 - 16:59== I just woke up, a little over two hours ago. I haven't eaten, mom's gone. I don't feel like studying or working out or doing anything because my schedule is ruined. I'm not gonna sleep later, we'll see how that goes. I'll skip studying for maybe two days, I want to regain my schedule/routine back.

==15 - 22:11== So, I've skipped my studies for almost 4 days, only continued today. Yesterday, mom and I went to see the psychiatrist and got prescribed meds (along with some new ones). The psychiatrist was amazing, he guessed agoraphobia and panic-attack tendencies right off the bat (that's what I've been suspecting). He upped my antidepressants and lowered my antipsychotics. However, there's one thing I can't guarantee, which is not drinking coffee. I can't not drink coffee, that's like a death sentence. But we don't have coffee now anyways so there's that.

==16 - 22:31== I woke up late, around 3 PM, even though I have a small dosage for my meds. My sleep schedule is still fucked. Anyways, I immediately studied as soon as I woke up but my brain is just not functioning without coffee. I need coffee in my life. So, I used the remaining 50 pesos on my GCash to buy me and my mom's coffee. Mine will last until Friday. I was also stuck on *Mendel*'s laws of inheritance, so much so that I had to watch some Youtube videos about it and I only got it when an Indian Youtuber explained it. This is what it feels like to be stuck on a certain topic—I should be accustomed to this from now on since I'm going to take Computer Science.

==17 - 21:38== It's Thursday so I get to use the laptop, as usual. I tried to ask for my aunt's laptop so I have something to use everyday but my uncle uses it. My mom told me the laptop is mine originally, my brother bought it for me to use. Anyways, I finished a few chapters of The Odin Project Foundations course. I feel like I learned a ton today when I focused on practice instead of note-taking. I also tried to find universities which offers Computer Science. I listed them all down along with the estimated tuition fee and where the campuses are near me. I'm gonna talk to my parents about it maybe tomorrow or when they're both awake and free. Originally, I was planning on applying to PUP but I found out they don't accept graduates from other strands, and even if they do, the GWA from Grade 10 and 11 should be 90. I wish December would come sooner, days seem to slow down lately. I need my money to buy stuff and change my phone battery. I'm also near 1000 albums in RYM, I just need 27 more albums to listen to (I already set up the list and I'll finish it before New Year's).

==21 - 1:21== I forgot to mention, it's my birthday yesterday. My brother and his girlfriend bought cake and mom cooked spaghetti. I thought there won't be anything but they bought stuff for me still. I spent my past two days watching ***Attack On Titan***. I was supposed to finish all seasons today but I just found out there's a sixth season. I can't sleep because I drank some coffee, I still won't regain my sleep schedule at this point. I have to sleep, or else I'll be a zombie again tomorrow. I have a lot of things to do tomorrow.

==21 - 22:18== I finished ***Attack On Titan*** today. God, how I need the ending. I studied for like 4 hours today. It should've been more than 5 hours but I'm not sure why I was such in a rush to finish things quickly—even my chores I finished hastily. Tomorrow it will be better.

==22 - 22:20== I woke up late again because I keep trying to continue my dream. I still went straight to studying though. I did 5 pomodoros. I'll try to do 6 or 7 tomorrow. I swear to god if I don't wake up early tomorrow.

==23 - 23:19== I did 6 pomodoros today even though I woke up pretty late to continue my dream. I dreamt of Michaela and I being together. It feels weird. I feel weird.

==24 - 18:40== I woke up pretty early today, which was surprising; I woke up around 9 AM. I proceeded to code and study immediately. I finished the rock-paper-scissor game from The Odin Project, albeit with some difficulties (I got stuck for a long time). I asked on Discord but it turns out, I solved my own problem before anyone can even reply to my message (I deleted the message). I finished early because the next step in the Foundations course is installing the Node.js. I don't know my brother's password so I have to ask him to install it for me. I'm listening to albums currently, to make up for the times I couldn't. I still haven't received any news from Mardie.

==26 - 4:17== I can't sleep at all. I woke up pretty late yesterday because I wanted to continue my dream. It backfired. I just studied a little bit of Japanese then slacked off by watching two ***August Underground*** films. And now I can't sleep. Help me.

==28 - 1:36== I've been busy. I tried the 12-hour pomodoro series and I lasted only 10 hours with a mix of Japanese and Biology studies. I don't think I can do 12 hours everyday, I'll be too burnt out. I'll do just 10 and I'm not gonna put everything in a tight schedule—whatever happens, happens.

==30 - 1:23== I woke up late but still managed to study for 8 hours straight. My dad got his salary today so we ate KFC.

## December

==1 - 3:39== I attempted the PUPCET (technically ACET) yesterday and I got bored halfway through it, only to learn there's no science portion (which I was waiting for). I also learned that there won't be a PLMAT, only an admissions ranking based on Grade 11 grades. But I'll still study, because I like studying. 12 hours a day should be enough.

==1 - 22:29== I didn't code nor study today because (1) my brother still hasn't installed Node.js, and (2) for some reason—lack of sleep—I couldn't get my brain to work properly to do coding problems on Code Wars dot com. What I did was just listen to albums and transfer liked RYM lists to my ***shit to listen to*** list. Also, I found out those who have a GWA of 96-100 in grade 11 are more likely to get accepted in PLM. My grade 11 average grade is 92 and I'm not confident with that. If only there will be a PLMAT and perhaps I do well in that, then I can say I have a chance of being accepted. At this point, I'll just probably study at a random school and then transfer to UP/PUP/PLM in my 2nd year.

==2 - 20:23== I woke up 6 PM, I ate 10+ takoyaki balls and watched Youtube. I don't feel like studying today. I'll just make this my rest day and then study on Saturday and Sunday.

==3 - 20:17== I don't feel like studying more today... I stopped at reviewing my flashcards. I feel kind of down honestly.

==3 - 22:16== Heya it's me again. I told you I didn't feel like studying today but I'll make it up tomorrow by studying 12 hours. I'm feeling quite discouraged but I'm not gonna give up yet. I'll ace the entrance exam for UMak on May. I'll stick to studying 12 hours a day.

==5 - 00:14== So I woke up pretty late yesterday. I only managed to study for 6 hours but I finished one topic which is great. Tomorrow I'll study for 12 hours.

==6 - 8:27== I haven't slept yet. Yesterday I woke up at 5:30 PM. I attempted a 12-hour study session but only lasted 10 hours into the next day. I don't really feel sleepy and I don't know when I'm supposed to study for today's schedule. I drank two mugs of coffee.

==7 - 2:47== I got a lot of studying to do later because I didn't study yesterday (technically I did but that schedule was for the day before).

==7 - 22:22== I studied only a bit, also a bit reluctant and lazy. I didn't go through 12 hours of studying. I'm marking this day as rest day and study on Sunday.

==9 - 5:18== I didn't get to use the laptop yesterday because my brother didn't go to work so I just slept. Woke up around almost 11 PM.

==12 - 20:44== I've been procrastinating so hard lately. I just don't feel like studying. But I'll still push myself to study 12 hours a day. We didn't go to NCMH today because the line is very long. Mom negotiated that we go on Friday.

==15 - 3:01== I woke up at almost 11 PM, for Christ's sake. I didn't get to study so I studied around past midnight to try and put information in my head but fucking physics just can't enter my brain. I don't get it and I'm failing the tests in Khan Academy. I probably need a break. I'll continue this later.

==17 - 00:20== We ate *takoyaki* today. I woke up around 6 PM. I didn't study.

==20 - 9:04== We went to NCMH yesterday. We did a lot of waiting. We also went to Shangrila, ate stuff and have my sister to get checked up at a health center (where we also did a lot of waiting). When we came back home I was so sleepy that I didn't get to study. Now I'll attempt studying (after I listen to albums). I'll start at 12 PM.

==20 - 19:48== My mom's late churchmate's kids are staying at our house for the night and the 7-year-old girl will sleep beside me. I was so awkward and I didn't know how to act around a kid especially when she keeps looking at me all interested and curious. I lend her my drawing stuff and books to read but she got quickly bored by them. I finally finished one-dimensional motion on physics without failing hard.

==23 - 9:11== I got a bit socially overwhelmed yesterday and the day before because of that small kid. I'm glad she didn't overstayed her welcome, or else I would've flipped. My sleep schedule is starting to go back to normal. Yesterday, I started duplicating my playlists because my anxiety that my Spotify account will be gone soon has heightened.

==24 - 20:35== I didn't study today nor do I plan on studying for the next coming week. I only watched ***Adventure Time*** today. I think I'm planning on duplicating all of my playlists before January 1 (or until). Let's see if I can make it.

==26 - 00:36== Yesterday was Christmas.. I know I'm agnostic and my family doesn't really celebrate it but we went to my grandma's house and celebrated it with my mom's side of the family nonetheless. I wore my best outift. I received 2,000 pesos (which is more than what I needed) and I got candies, cookies, chocolates and other stuff. I also got so stuffed. We went to get Starbucks, there was a long line of Gen Z kids. I got a Strawberries & Cream Frappuccino—the one I usually get. I actually had fun. When we got home, we ate lasagna and opened more presents. I also ordered stuff I want on Shopee and I just hope they come earlier or later than expected—and not arrive at 31 nor January 1.

==28 - 23:00== My thick-ass journal arrived today which was nice, I'm so excited to fill it up. Right now, I only have 1,000 pesos left and I'm thinking of buying clothes and printing images for journaling purposes. Also, PLM announced admissions for 2023-2024 and yes they have PLMAT, let's fucking go!!!

==29 - 21:59== I used the laptop today, not to code, but to duplicate my playlists. It's a never-ending process. I can't wait for next year, I have tons to do.

==31 - 1:19== I woke up around 2 PM and proceeded to print the pictures for my journal. I paid 750 pesos for 15 pages (177 images in all) on matte photo paper. After that, we went to the clothes shop and my dad bought me a black muscle tee, a red grunge long-sleeved shirt, a thick warm-colored flannel and a buttoned-shirt with scribbles on it (a rare find if you ask me). Then, my siblings and I played *Dungeon Mayhem* for 3 rounds. My sister also treated me to KFC for dinner. It's a nice day even though I don't have any money left. I can't wait to journal next year.

==31 - 23:36== It's nearing January 1, the start of a new year as I'm typing this. I'll just make it brief. Today was a good day. We ate a lot of food; sushi, spaghetti, nachos and good 'ol softdrinks (also coffee). I'm not gonna sleep later and I'm also not gonna go to the my family's New Year's celebration at Marikina. I want to start my year alone, I prefer it that way. I hope they respect that. I think I'll just spend my time journaling and using the laptop tomorrow. With that being said, I take a sip of coffee from my trustec coffee thermos, happy new year.

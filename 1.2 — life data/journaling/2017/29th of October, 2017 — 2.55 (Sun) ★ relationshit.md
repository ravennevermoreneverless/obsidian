For some unknown reasons, I was really tempted to type down my thoughts. I feel like there are things I should let out, so that my mind would be at peace. I feel lonely. Well, romantic-wise. I'm still young, yes, but there is this undeniably noticable gap inside my heart that needs to be filled. It's not that easy. I need it urgently to be filled. By someone. I want someone to hold, to hug, to cuddle with, to talk to with everything and anything, to kiss, to travel with and a lot more things. I know I have family, I have friends..but it's still incomplete. I need it desperately. So I'm risking my chances with relationships right now. Maybe I'm feeling this because I'm reading too much fanfictions. Silly me. There's no such thinngs like those. But hey, fanfictions might be **just** fictions but they are made accordingly to be like **just** how it is in real life or are based on real life events and people's behaviors. So, 70/30 chances it can happen. And yet, here I am, hoping for my real life fanfiction story, like, poor me. Oh, I've got a long way to go.

I'm back after, what, I think, 467 years..or so..

I couldn't sleep since I drank too much cold coffee.. AGAIN. I re-watched Sakurasou andit never gets old, geez. But I only got to watch until episode 13, I need to get the other 11 more episodes to finish it. Gosh, I can't believe I forgot how much anime makes me happy and overwhelmed. That episode 12 freakin' gave me the goosebumps and I'm not even kidding.

It's been a while writing like this since I rarely get a hold of my big bro's laptop charger. My laptop's getting pretty old, it can't even handle large ppis of multimedia resolution. It has screen deficiencies (those thin red lines) a*lthough i*t's not noticable. And I'm running low on storage.. I seriously want to stock up lots and lots of animes, movies, music and Girls' Generation since semestral break is nearing. Only 3 days left and I'm not gonna be able to see my dick friends lol. I'd be leaving with my siblings to my grandma's condominium. We always stay there for vacation and I hope I wouldn't be one heck of a bored potato there. I wish my bro would come so I can use my laptop.

Shit I got tons of projects to do and attendance sheets to complete but here I am, typing my thoughts away like I don't give a shit lol sue me. I will YOLO my way through this, exams on thursday and friday anyway. AND I HAVEN'T REVIEWED. Wait, not like I do anyway LOL SUE ME TWICE.

On top of that, I'm completely bankrupt. Like zero extra funds for the vacation. Zero funds for loads and foods. And I got a lot of shit to pay for. And lots of shit to save money for. HAHA fuck this, I'll just go with the flow.

I hope everything goes well.

I'm signing off. I've got nothing more to say LOL.

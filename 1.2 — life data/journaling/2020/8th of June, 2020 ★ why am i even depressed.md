i've been trying to avoid it so much, getting all the distractions i can but i know it's still lurking there somewhere. yes, i can still speak, i can still take a bath and enjoy music but i can't bring myself to pick up a pencil to draw, pick up a pen to write, or pick up a book to read. i barely ate, i've been losing weight. i'm not sad, i can't cry. i'm not lonely, i don't want to talk to people. i just feel so..detached. 

why do i even feel this way?

i'm trying to get to the bottom of it again because the reasons kept changing everytime like it were excuses. everything just feels so wrong, nothing ever goes right; at least to myself. i never saw improvements. perhaps it just keeps getting worse and worse as days go by. or is it my pessimistic self speaking? am i damaged beyond repair? have i gone through so much trauma that has broke me so? why am i like this?   

i truly hate myself for being so flawed in so many ways possible. i hate myself for being weak, self-centered, so uncaring and so ungrateful. i hate myself for being incapable of love and i hate myself even more for never letting anyone get too close to try. i hate myself for being so twisted and fucked up but i hate myself even more for giving up so easily and not even trying to make anything better. i hate myself for existing but i hate myself even more because i'm still not fucking dead--dear god, i fucking hate myself.   

maybe, that's it, huh? how could i ever love someone if i can't even love myself? i've ran away from myself and my emotions for so long it feels like i'm a completely different person now. who was i before this all happened? is that why i could hardly remember anything before turning 18? what has become of me? 

now i'm here, still here. i'm stuck because i made myself stuck. i'm still going through this endless cycle because as twisted as it may sound, i don't want it to stop and move forward. it's entirely my fault that i'm in this situation but am i afraid? what am i afraid of? change? i don't want to wake up. no, don't wake me up because i'm not dreaming. and i'm not facing reality either. 

i just want to lay here.

and do what?

do nothing. 

and then what?  

right now, i don't really have a solution and i dont seem to care enough to do anything about it. 

time will kill me soon and maybe that's what i wanted all along.

after nearly 10 months of being depressed and suicidal, i finally acknowledged the fact that i transitioned to being manic after a whole month of a mixed episode(july). 

you have no idea how fucking difficult it is right now. i'm becoming so much worse. i think the manic episode started after that huge meltdown i had last week of july. and i can't believe i didn't see the signs sooner; 

i almost never sleep anymore, i became more unusually talkative and social, my attention span is so fucked that i can't read two consecutive sentences, impulsive as fuck, massive self-admiration, strange false over-optimism and the urge to do freakiNg EVERYTHING. 

and those are just the small things!! what's worse is that i have no idea what i'm feeling anymore, i don't have any control whatsoever. i'm having a terrible terrible identity crisis. i can't differentiate between who i really am and my mentall illness. i don't know what is true experience to me or if i'm just having delusions and false memories. 

my reality, my feelings and thoughts are so incredibly distorted; i feel so disconnected from everything. i'm just trying to see myself through people's eyes to tell me who i am. i'm holding onto any pieces of "me" from the passages in my journals to tell me who i was.  

even still, i am just so confused right now, i'm literally vibrating with excitement for absolutely no reason and i don't know what to do.

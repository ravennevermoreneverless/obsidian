I slept for almost an entire day yesterday. My body feels sluggish right after. I want to do things but everything just feels so heavy. My mind is clouded, too, I'm too empty. My self-harm wounds are almost healed already. I don't think I want to slash my wrist again. I also don't want to smoke or drink again. Or stop my meds. It's scary how I will lose control of myself the moment I'm in an episode. I wouldn't have control of or be aware of my judgments, my decisions, my emotions, cognitive abilities, heck not even my own body. In my head, in that moment, all I can think about are things I wouldn't even think about when in a normal state. And I genuinely believe my thoughts, as if they are mineâ€”even though they are and at the same time, they're not. And it's fucking scary. I have no idea how to cope with this mental illness at all, absolutely no idea. No one knows how to handle me in my worst states either. I could kill myself and they still wouldn't know what to do. I feel so alone in this world. All I have is myself and I'm still betraying me.

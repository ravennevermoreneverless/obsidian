The scent of death looms closer and I can almost see him beside my mom. It's only so soon now, and my life's about to change—something that will absolutely destroy me. The things I've always taken for granted, all taken away in just an instant. Even if it doesn't, my life will only grow harsher. I don't know why I've always led such a shitty life. But then I remembered this one podcast about cause and effect, and how every decision you make and don't make, every decision the world makes—it will have a karmic consequence, not just to an individual person, but also to everyone; because we are a collective whole. And I just think that, all the suffering in the world, all the pain inflicted to those undeserving of it, it's all because evil exists in everyone. It seems unfair now, as an individual who have lived such a harsh life. What did I do to deserve this? Absolutely nothing—it's just that way because we are alive. And now I'm losing my mom, I'm also about to lose my dad, and I thought I didn't have a heart to even cry for people but it hurts so much. Things will only continue to get worse from here. I wish things could've stayed the same, I wish I was 12 again, but I guess it's just not supposed to be that way.

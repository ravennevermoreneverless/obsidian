how can you just accept that you're an adult and that you will never be a kid again? how can you just accept that you're supposed to have your shit together? how can you just accept that you have responsibilities? how can you just accept that you're completely on your own from now on, whether you like it or not? how can you just accept that the life you're so used to is just supposed to disappear? how can you just accept that you'll probably never have the life that you always wanted? how can you just accept that you're completely disadvantaged in every ways just because you were born with an illness and that it will continue to hinder you in every step of your life? how can you just accept that the people you thought would stay with you for most of your life will soon die? how can you just accept that people leave? how can you just accept all these changes? how can you just accept that you're born in a world where you're expected to do good things and be a good person despite every shitty thing you've been through? how can you just accept that? how can anyone just "go by" in life? how can anyone just grow up? i don't know, no one taught me anything. i'm so lost, i'm so alone, and i'm so scared.

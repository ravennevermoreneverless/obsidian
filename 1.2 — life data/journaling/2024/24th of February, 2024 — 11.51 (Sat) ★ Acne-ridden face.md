I have the worst fucking acne breakout ever. And here I thought it couldn't get worse. They just keep coming! I know it all started when I've been using kojic acid soap everyday, and not the good brand at that. Then it got really really bad when I started going to work. My lifestyle was shitty, I was living in my most unhealthy yet. I smoked, I drank, my sleep was shit, I eat junk, I don't take care of my hygiene at all—my life is completely out of my control and I was just watching and letting it all happen. How did it turn this bad? Why did I let it turn this bad? I hate seeing my face in the mirror, looking like mosquitoes bit parts of my face. And it's even worse that I don't have money to save my skin—because I spent it all on random unnecessary shit; because even my spending habit was out of control, as well! I'm so annoyed and also scared that I wouldn't be able to save my face in time (before starting school). I'm trying to take back control of my life again, starting by quitting my job. Working as an adult threw me off guard. I wasn't prepared to work while also taking good care of myself. Oh, did I mention I skipped my meds, too, when I started working? Yeah, it was horrible. I'm trying to keep that consistent now, too. But seriously, my skin needs to improve, or I'll kill myself.

I slit my wrists for the first time in a long time. It weirdly didn't hurt enough. I thought I wouldn't be able to handle just one cut, like I did back in 2020, but this time I made several cuts. They weren't deep enough, next time I’ll make sure to cut past the skin. I couldn't draw enough blood so I was pretty disappointed. But I felt satisfied. I sent Kanola an image of my slit wrists, she stopped talking to me. I also sent IC a photo, don’t know if she’d seen it. CJ hasn't replied to my messages either after I asked about our date and why she was silent. I posted a blurred photo of my self-harm. Nobody cared. It's funny how no one really knows how to handle a self-destructive suicidal person. I just laughed bitterly for my attempts of getting attention and decided to just fucking get over it, for my own sake. I’m gonna go to NCMH tomorrow to get my meds. I kind of feel glad that I can cut myself like this. I feel like it will become addicting. I still think about overdosing on my meds, or jumping off the bridge. These thoughts are ridiculously strong. Nothing and no one’s stopping me from committing suicide. It’s just so easy.

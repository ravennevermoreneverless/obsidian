I don't really have the energy to enumerate the things that happened yesterday up to earlier past midnight. The day started with me being happy and enjoying the ticketing process. I also enjoyed my lunch break and break with my colleagues. We went to *Jollikod* twice, with me using Roxy's mango-flavored vape instead of smoking a cigarette. I had a fun time talking to Camille near the end of our shift. The final result came: me and Sarah is endorsed to the production. The rest will have a 3-day extended nesting period. I'm just feeling really sad about it. I even talked to Camille on text, saying my goodbyes to her while also showing her I liked her the whole time. I am sad about it because she said she won't continue with the training anymore. So there's no guarantee we'll see each other again. I'm also feeling this way for my other colleagues during training. All the time we spent, they will all just be memories. I want to cry. People come and go, as cheesy and wistful as it sounds. That's life. I had fun. I really did. I'm glad I was with these people, I'm glad they're with me the whole ride. I won't forget them. This might not be goodbye, but it's safer to assume it will be, as attachments will only lead to heartbreak. Time will pass, I will meet new people again, especially tomorrow. It's normal to feel sad about everything, right?

I can't sleep. I forgot to take my antipsychotic last night. Now I feel weird. I can't sleep. I can't focus on doing anything else because my mind's a mush. 

I fell asleep. I woke up and found out we're not going to our aunt's, meaning I'm not gonna get money. I'm free for the rest of the day. I'm just really glad I fell asleep because I was almost palpitating earlier. 

While reading *Haruki Murakami*'s ***Dance, Dance, Dance*** and listening to *TOOL*'s ***Lateralus***, one of the jobs I applied for messaged me on Indeed saying I passed their pre-screening test. They asked me to come by to QC on Wednesday for the interview. I was so pumped that I couldn't focus on reading more. 

My sister and I went out to get my résumé printed but the print shop was closed. We got back home and went back out again to buy chips since mom wanted to watch a film. We watched ***Train to Busan***. I bumped its rating to 4.5 stars. Now, mom is watching a series in our room. I have nothing better to do. 

Before the clock struck 12 midnight earlier, I wanted to smoke to greet the new year. But there aren't any stores open nearby and people are setting off firecrackers in the street so I couldn't. I guess it's a sign to change. Near midnight, I specifically placed *Parannoul*'s ***Beautiful World*** in order so that it's the song playing at 12 o'clock. And so, I opened the window. I took my coffee, the song playing in my ears, while I looked at the fireworks in the dark sky. Just when the song reached its breakdown climax, there were fireworks everywhere I looked. I took a sip of my coffee and relished the moment. I thought '*This is gonna be my year.'* Everything will change. Some pleasant, some worse—but I'll live. 

I can't sleep and I feel strange. All I can think about is my interview on Wednesday and CJ. I’m excited for the first one but the other? It's like, my mind is just doing it automatically, and yet, I don't feel the same kind of rush it had back then. It's like, my mind misses that obsessive feeling, that dopamine hit when I talk to her. But right now, it’s just… different. It's like I know I’m done with that phase and now my mind is suffering from boredom or some kind of withdrawal. I need something else to obsess over. My brain wouldn't feel complete if I’m not obsessed with something. It's weird, this feeling of tranquility and the lack of intensity. I’m calm, but at the risk of being bored. For a long time I’ve viewed boredom as something sacrilegious, like it's a crime. But really, is it such a bad thing after all?

Empty. Unmotivated. Detached. A tad bit melancholic. I don't feel like doing anything. How long am I going to be like this? I want to do things but I just don't have the energy to do it. It's annoying. I'm annoyed at every single thing. I haven't showered for days. I need to get another supply of meds soon, I'm running out. My dad's slowly killing himself with alcohol and cigarettesâ€”and we're doing nothing but watch him self-destruct. I want to feel something, too. Dad, would you give me some of your cigarettes? I miss feeling something. The things I used to obsess over just doesn't give me the same feeling of high again. I'm afraid this won't pass. Why do I feel like this won't pass? I wouldn't cry if my dad died. I will only cry if my mom cries. I feel different, from everyone else. Is it loneliness? Or a special kind of one? I'm not trying to be special. I just want to talk to people. I want to have actual conversations. Somehow, I can't have that. People are so closed off. They just never want to talk about stuff. Maybe if I reached out. Maybe if I opened up, too, they will eventually. Maybe the change happens with me, when I start doing something that initiates that change. I feel different, but still I feel like I'm not at my most different. The more I want to be myself, the more I become alienated from everyone around me. I'm a lonely person. Probably not the loneliest, but lonely nonetheless.

There's just something deeply wrong with me. I'm tired of pretending to have a connection with everyone I know and will ever meet, it's incredibly exhausting. Every single time, I unconsciously automatically put on this persona, just to get along with people, just so I wouldn't be alone and lonely. And every single time, it drives me further away from them. I'm just lying to myself and to everyone. I have no idea how to love people, moreso create a meaningful emotional connection. There's just this massive force field separating me from everyone, that I can't pass through, no matter what I do. In return, there's also this massive void at the very core of my being. I'm so fucking unbearably lonely but I don't want these superficial bonds anymore either. I crave affection, but I can't even say confidently that I can give back the same energy, the same "love"â€”not even to my friends, family, and potential partner. I sincerely think, from the bottom of my heart, that I'll always be alone, cursed to never knowing love for humankind at all.

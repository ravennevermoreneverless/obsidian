Pretty weird dream. It's kinda like a mystery game but in real life. With a mix of the anime ***Parasyte*** that traumatized me for life.

It was kinda a weird day; we were all still awake, half-past 3 in the morning. My cousin, ate Mae, was here. We were all on our phones when suddenly, brother stood up and got dressed. Apparently, he received a message from our tita Vhic, asking to buy a specific 4 boxes of donut and to go there at Makati immediately. Of course, we were shookt at first, but the message seems pretty urgent so we gotta go. We skampered like panicked squirrels on a deforestation activity in a forest. We hurried to find whatever clothes we find and set off. I got meself a set of grey hoodie and shorts along with a pair of old chuck taylor converse and we're going.

We arrived at past 4 in the morning. It was still dark outside, and the morning breeze was too cold. Odd, I thought. We weren't at the usual fancy condominium but instead, we are at an old house in a village surrounded by trees and a farm. But what's alarming is, there are vehicles surroung the house. There are ambulances, and reporters..and a few white vans and black SUVs that looked like straight from a science department. Just what the fuck was happening?

We reached the front door, still holding those boxes of donuts. Our aunt greeted us and let us come inside. It was eerily quiet. Only the 4 of them are there, my aunt, my tito, and my lola. We were confused because we all know my cousin kuya MicMic, my cousin's wife ate Kat, their son and our pamangkin, Janishi, and my other tito tito Erning was there also but they were missing. We figured that they were just away.

So we didn't ask nor speak. Our tita just led us to our respective rooms; ate Mae on a separate room while me, my younger brother Idoy and my kuya Tam in one room. Once we have settled and ate some donuts, my tita handed us some 
guns. Like wtf, where the fuck did she get these from? Along with some bullets, we keep the gun. And she said creepily, "We will get revenge." And when those words left her mouth, that's when I know a part of her has gone mad.

She explained what happened. Apparently, there was a fucking Parasyte that has gone loose in the city, and it comes every night to that particular house in Makati where we are staying for the moment to kill every living border in the house. Just this night, baby Janishi and our tito Erning just got eaten by the said killer. We were shookt and scared but we couldn't do anything. We have to stay in that house to prolong the time of killing of the Parasyte. For the scientists to capture it and do some tests, also to avenge the deaths of our family members.

Days have gone by, little by little, slowly, every border in the house is getting killed but eerily, we were so calm about it. Every night, we stay quiet  and feel the presence of the Parasyte in the house; feeling if we are the next to be slaughtered. Terrified but calm, is what we're feeling.

It was on the fourth day when we've witnessed it. How the Parasyte kills. We stayed way past bedtime in the living room, playing with our phones and watching TV when suddenly, we hear creaking from outside the house. We knew it is the killer, so we skampered and hid. We were too far from our bedrooms upstairs and it will take too much time for us to run from here. So we stayed in the living room hidden in different places.

An agonizing screem came next after the long suffocating silence. Chills ran down our spines, shutting our eyes, awaiting what's going to happen next, hoping for the killer to not sense us.

  
"Please no no, don't kill me and my baby.. I beg you... Please!" was the pleads of the man that we heard, his words coated with fear. Along with the harsh cries of an infant. It seems like they are being dragged outside.  Fast forward, when they are far enough, we went to the winow to see what's up and voila. The Parasyte was eating from the man and gobbled up the baby. It was the most horrifying and disturbing sight I have ever seen.

After that night, I figured I should try and learn how to use the gun.

The next day, we were more aware. We trained and figured out who will be eaten next. We learned to use defense and weapons.

Night comes. It was eerily quiet yet again. My grip on the gun tightened, my knuckles were becoming white. I looked at my siblings and they were as fearful as me. I clenched my jaw. We were not certain of who will the Parasyte come after next but why does it feel like this night is special? Anytime now..

That's when the knob of the door moves. Like someone's trying to open from the outside. We have locked the door.

I didn't wake uo halfway of my dream. I must be really sleepy. I dreamed about living in a bus with a strict supervisor handling it. No food unless he says so. No water or baths, until he says so. It's restricting. But then, one day happened and I got up and washed my face. I didn't know if he saw me but he called me up. I was shocked when he assigned me as leader. The dream was a blur. I only remember taking pictures of the sunset and the huge moon. It was surrealbut I took a picture nonetheless. Jeanina was there.

Flash forward to my old school. I ws always with Jellaicah, walking around and buying our lunch then with some unknown person...(?) I remembered Eliza being touchy-feely with me. And then this unknown person (feels like a launchpadder like Yoshie and quiet) studies there, too. And he accompanies me to Ma'am Ri√±on's class in which I'm already late btw then to Ma'am Masola's class (I'm late again). Thankfull she wasn't there yet but nope, we just saw her walking fast towards class and we raced there, too. We met at the stairs but then I felt a sore feeling on my foot and asked her/him to go without me. Then I showed my sore toe lol. 

Next is the one where the mysterious person XMLR? I think? We hang out. It was awesome. Until my tita Jane and her friend came and watched us play. After we played, he put his name on the side of the woodboard then I copied him, I lettered his name on the other side but the marker was running out. He said it's okay and then my tita invited us to a nice, warm bath. The dream ends there.

But somewhere there, I remember Jaime taking me to Pineda 7/11, then going home. I remember walking on the streets of Pineda at night with a flask of glitter at hand and flicks it to any dog that came near me. I got that glitter from when Jellaicah accompanied me to 7/11 to buy stuff. We just checked the notebooks and pencils, we didn't buy anything, actually. When we're going out, I prayed the cashier won't suspect us because we didn't buy anything. Then I wondered what would happen if I stole something out. When we were out, I was shocked to find a flask of magenta glitter in my pocket.

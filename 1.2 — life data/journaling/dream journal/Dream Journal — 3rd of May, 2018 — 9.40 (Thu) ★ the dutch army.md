It felt like I've been sleeping for hours but the truth is I've only been sleeping for 3 hours and 40 minutes. My dream is still pretty blurry. The only thing I remember is the last dream. It's very awkward to say but it's my mom and dad having sex (EW. MAJOR EW) on the bed ehere the native US people are supposed to live and the Philippine army toppling the place, and my sister is inside the hut. It's a weird one. The dutch army is finding ways to destroy Philippines (bombing he place and everything) because they think we're evil. And America is evil, too, they said. They demonstrated a few basic strategies that are kinda funny. And there's this moment where my brother wants to us to play computer with him by 10 AM but I have an important appointment by 10:30 AM so we rearranged it. That's the only thing I remember, I'm gonna go back to sleep.

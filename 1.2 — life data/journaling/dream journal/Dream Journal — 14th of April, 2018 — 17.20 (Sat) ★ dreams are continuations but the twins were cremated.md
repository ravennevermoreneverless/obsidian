These days, my dreams are becoming more vivid and reaching out to connect with reality. It's crazy how I remember every single part and detail of the dreams I have. And I have this theory that: our dreams are little parts or pieces, continuations of our previous dreams (even from a long time ago) that forms a complete story. I know so because I remember each dream I have and they are always continuing those dreams that I had 2 - 3 years ago. Now, I can't write all my dreams anymore because there is just too many so maybe I'll just write the important and most vivid ones (later) maybe... 

Earlier I just found out some freakish thing in my gallery. I opened my gallery and found that I had 6 blank pictures saved (or captured? Idk) during between 2:48 AM to 2:51 AM. When I remember clearly that I was on my laptop during those times. And when I open a picture, it goes black. And when I open the gallery, the pictures go blinking from black to white then from white to black again. I tried restarting to see if it vanishes but it's still there. Creepy. 

So remember when I said I had many dreams earlier? There's this one dream that sorta creeps me out. So, I found an old scrapbook at the beach, it's all wet and soggy. Then I went home and looked through the book. It's about a twin, named Lash and Mary. They're kinda American, idk. Then it tells about their life and all. Then there's this weird picture that covers the whole page. A picture containing many kids with blank facial expressions just staring at the camera. It's eerie because the pictures were brown, black and white. Then my little sister saw me looking at the book and she went to me. She looked at the picture and stopped. Her expression turned cold and vacant, almost as if she was possessed. She turned to me and whispered to my ear, "in the kitchen." I froze. I turned the book to its last page and I found out. The twins died and was cremated. Then I woke up. You know what's creepy? Because these past few days, I always thought my sister pass me by running or climbing the double-decker bed only to find out later she's somewhere else. The twins have the same age and height as my sister. It leaves me wondering, what if this house has some kind of history that I didn't know of, the twins per se, and it might be that their ashes are hidden somewhere inside the kitchen? Then I might actually be psychic. It's some kind of mystery. It excites me and scares me a the same time. I just hope things turn out well. 

BTW, I didn't know yesterday was Friday the 13th. :|

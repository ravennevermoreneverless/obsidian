I slept in the afternoon. The last dream I had was pretty creepy. So, we live in some kind of boarding house and my mom's friend who is an acupuncturist (if that's even a word LOL). At first, she was really kind and friendly. She gives free treatments to my dad and mom. She even cleaned a spare room just for one of our siblings to have a room. That's when things started to go crazy. Pins and needles were left behind everywhere. On the bed, on the chairs, on the floor. We started to get worried. It was that night I found her putting pins on my dad's bed. Before my dad lied down, luckily I was able to stop him and remove the pins. I also removed the ones she put on my mom's bed. After hag, I confronted her. Then she started threatening to attack. I grabbed my dad's phone, which he offered, and ran outside to call the authorities. She followed me and tried to attack me, stab me with a needle. But I was faster, I ran outside. 3 minutes after the call and the authorities are already outside. Surprisingly, she calmed down. Then she sat down and talked. The dream ends there. 

Before the dream was finished, there is another dream before that. It was kind of a fantasy/action type of dream, we had magic! Harry Potter was there and Hermione and they were battling this dragon person (he can transform into dragon) and Harry Potter can, too. While me and my siblings just stay back and fight the small fries. We had magic, it was so fun. My older brother showed me a fun trick (I forgot what it's called but it was mentioned in the dream). Where you can vanish a body part in one second and in one touch and grow it back again, just as fast. He tried this on our little brother. He vanished his finger and then grow it back again. It ended with a small painless crack. It was so awesome! I wanted to do that, too!

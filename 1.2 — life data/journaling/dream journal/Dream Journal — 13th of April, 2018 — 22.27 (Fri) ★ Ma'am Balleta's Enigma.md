### TALKS ABOUT DREAMS AND THIRD EYES

Recently I've been having weird dreams that eerily somewhat turns real. Like that time I dreamt of going to my cousins' house and then a few days later; we did. And then the day before yesterday, I dreamt of eating donuts and today, we did. Today, I dreamt of my friend Roshelyn. She went here at my house (she's small af) and we hung out and stuff. Then she went home for a bit to check on stuff so I followed her just outside and there were black cats. Then she came back with a huge bleeding wound on her head, she seems shaken and frightened like something happened back at her home (weird thing was that when I went ouside earlier irl, those same black cats were staring at me with wide eyes.) After that, I dreamt of going to Lauren Jauregui's solo concert and I didn't get picked to go up on stage with her (I met a few fanboys) and then fast forward when I'm in college in a lecture hall (Ma'am Balleta is the lecturer) and asked about the machine she presented which is *Enigma*. No one knows the answer and they gave ridiculous answers so I answered (I perfectly remembered what I said) and then I woke up. It felt good being right and being the only one who knows the right answer.

The only thing I remembered in my dream was Lorde picked me up from school and considering she's a world famous singer; people were envious of me. Especially when we were walking on Capitol 8 and she put an arm around me even though she's slightly shorter than me. I accidentally said something mean to her and she walked away. Right when I was riding a jeepney back home, I saw her walking and I immediately stopped the jeepney and went to her. I apologized to her, we were okay, and she invited me to her house. It was getting pretty dark but I said yes. This is when things start to get freaky. Lorde, becamse my most hated substitute teacher in Filipino, Claire, and I went to her house to watch a movie with her in her room; on her bed. It rained so I couldn't go home so her parents insisted me to stay so I texted my parents that I can't go home early. We cuddled, while watching a movie, and she suddenly started leaning then BAM! It literally was the weirdest, most disgusting dream I've ever had. And I can't look at her the same way ever again without thinking that... And it doesn't help that she's always at practice... HELP ME.

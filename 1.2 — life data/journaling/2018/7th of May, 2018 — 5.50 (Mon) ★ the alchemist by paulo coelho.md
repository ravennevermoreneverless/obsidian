Today, I've finished a book; Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. It was a great read. Definitely one of my favorites and it taught me a lot. Here are the few lines I've liked throughout the ride. 

> "***Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the language of the world.***"

> "***It's not what enters men's mouth that's evil. It's what comes out of their mouths that is.***"

> "***One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.***"

> "***If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.***"


And that was it. My mom still haven't arrived. Yesterday, I had a fun time with my friend IC. We watched ***Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*** and ate and talked. It was nice talking with another fellow human other than my family. I'm sorry I couldn't say anything more of the book for I cannot express myself with words, though I can show you what I've learnwd theough my actions and the impact it has given me. 

And I also apologize for I haven't written my dream yesterday, I was really exhausted. Lucid dreaming can wait, yeah? I'm planning on going to the comp shop lager on and download X-Men movies. I hope Mom's okay.

> "***When each day is the same as the next, it's because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.***"

> "***I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.***"

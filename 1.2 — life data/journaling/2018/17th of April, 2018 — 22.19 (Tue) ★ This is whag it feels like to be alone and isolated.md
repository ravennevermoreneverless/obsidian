Today, I spent my day home alone. So I took advantage of this rare (not really) opportunity. I blasted the speakers with random unknown music that I've found on Spotify, made myself a cup of iced coffee, painted, drew, and read and looked at art. It was refreshing but when I was done with everything, it suddenly became quiet. Like, the silence was defeaning. I know I was alone but that's when I realized I was alone. Bloo rushed to my head and my world spinned around. This is what it feels like to be alone and isolated.

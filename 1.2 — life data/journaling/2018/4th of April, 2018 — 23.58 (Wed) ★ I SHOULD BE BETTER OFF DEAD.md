You know when you're an outcast? In the family, you're that ungrateful, untalented, up-to-no-good, shitty, troublesome, failure of a black sheep? I don't even know what's worse; being neglected ot being the butt of the shades; or BOTH. Sometimes, you're that kid left standing in the corner of dhame during Christmas family to get together with no gifts and money because your relatives forgot sboit you and you're just watching them laugh and with a wide smile you don't realize you're faking so that they can't see you unconsciously cry. And sometimes, you're that kid that does EVERY SINGLE THING wrong, all the mistakes and bad things they say you already did. You're that misunderstood kid that no one understands. You're that weird, problematic kid that is just a big nuisance and a baggage that needs to be dumped in the garbage dumpster because you are made of shit. You never do anything great or good. There is NOTHING to be proud of from you. You are a garbage. You are nothing. You should be scolded. You should be thrown around and hit upon. You DESERVE to be punished. You deserve to be treated like this. You are a BIG problem and you are BETTER off DEAD. You shouldn't have been born. You're adopted to us. You are not part of this family. You're not supposed to be here. You don't deserve to be cared for. You don't deserve to be LOVED. You are NOTHING. Why are you like this? Why are you even here? Why did God ever create you? You are the child of the devil. You deserve to be in the depths of hell, drowning in the sea of flames....... do you know how that feels? NO.

I'm a constant rejection in the family. The least loved middle child. The black sheep with the worst attitudes ever. The outsider that got lost inside this family. The ungrateful bitch that doesn't deserve all good blessings that comes her way. Yep, I am that. Sometimes, I've wondered why I still haven't left. Why? They would be happy, right? There won't be that autistic, mentally unstable kid that ruins the family anymore. That extra mouth that needs to be fed. Why is she still here anyway? I should be gone, right? I should be better off dead, right? Why do they even still bother, right? They should've left me in that dumpster ages ago. They should've aborted me when they found out there's a spawn of the devil inside my mom's tummy. They should've left me in that cow's shit, like they always say. I am SHIT. I am NOTHING. I am NOTHING.

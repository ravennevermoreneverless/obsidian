I haven't able to write earlier (which was 13h of February) not because it's unlucky but I just haven't got time (because I was sleeping). But nothing much has happened again earlier (gonna put yellow) except eating at Ministop with my friend's treat (grateful for that) and gonna run some errands later for the lettering. It's funny because she'll pay me 20 when my expenses would be 14 + 4 (she wants to meet up at Rotonda) so the lettering will be just 2 pesos. Bruh. So, yeah, I didn't put much effort on it. I don't do commissions, yknow (but usually I don't let them pay) but things will change, my friends, because I'm desperate for money and nothing is fucking free these days. So, yeah, I got nothing much to say today anyway. ~~# Camren~~

except for that. I'm still rooting for them. Things will come to light, I just know it. Today it's Valentine's Day and unlike the normies that pretend to be bitter just for the sake of being trendy, if I'm in a good mood I'd buy my friends cheap flowers. Bye. (Still not going to prom even if my classmate said I got potential for prom queen). (I drank coffee so I won't sleep bye).

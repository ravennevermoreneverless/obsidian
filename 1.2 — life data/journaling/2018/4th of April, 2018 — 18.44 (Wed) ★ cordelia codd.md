Yesterday I finished a book entitled ***Cordelia Codd: Not Just the Blues***. I say it's a fun read. It's by *Claire O' Brien* and it's kinda for kids. It's about a kid with a dream to be the "Greatest Costume designer in the history of cinema". And the 12-year-old Grade 7 encountered family problems, friendship problems and bullying. She had so many problems as a 12-year-old, I'm surprised she didn't turn out depressed but she had "rage episodes" and temperamental problems. Her parents almost got divorced and she had perr pressure but things got better eventually. It wasn't a happy ending.. but things hopefully will turn out great.

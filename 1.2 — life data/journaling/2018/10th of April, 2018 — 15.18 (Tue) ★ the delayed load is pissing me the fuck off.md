I'm having a fucking tantrum right now becaue life is so unfair. I'm being immature right now but who the fuck cares, right? I'm SOOO not in the modd for ANY shit. I don't know what to do, I'm going crazy over here. I've waited for 5 days for the fucking load because I'm internet-deprived for 5 fucking whole days. And I'm so thirsty it's making me dysfunctional and unstable. My mother promised me load today. TODAY. So I slept peacefully, I was all smiles for the day until she dropped the news that she'll give the money tomorrow like... are you fucking kidding me? Sure, some will say I'm overreacting but they don't know how much this means to me. I'm gonna fucking die here for this unwanted urges, itches, and burns from not having internet. I'm going crazy. And now, my friend Isabella will come to my house in like 2 hours because "she just wanted to see me", I mean, no offense, I appreciate the thought, but has she ever considered if I wanted to see people right now? Moreover, her? This is seriously pissing me off, I might cry in frustration. I'm so mad. Now I can't think straight and I can't talk straight without snapping. God, help me. I just want to sleep for the whole day. Yeah, I might go do that. Oh, and I think it's gonna rain shit-crazy. Perfect for my mood.

### MY OLD TRUSTY PHONE.
Well, most of the people in this generation can't be separated from their phone, much more when going out for a while. Phone is an essential item these days. It's a necessity and I'm not an exception. Even though my phone is a piece of cracked junk with glass, it still works! It has been more than a year now, I think, but it still works and is alive than ever! This phone helped me so much, I treasure it and I trust it so much, I can't go anywhere without it. I hope I can find a replacement soon enough because it's all worn out but I hope until that time comes, it will continue doing its job well. 

### MY PURSE.
Should I ask for more? This flowery purse holds all my valuable items (not really). My flash drives, earphones, money, hairbands, liptints, powder, miscellaneous and even a smaller purse! (Identical to this bigger purse but tiny). Sure, it's somewhat girly for me but hey, it's trusty and easy to carry anywhere.

### LE JOURNAL.
I have just recently did journal-keeping, it got me occupied, and I just want to say I'm loving it! And I can't go anywhere without it. It's my 12th day of journaling and I'm already almost halfway through with it. Maybe I'd be done with the pages by the end of February. So I gotta keep updating. Anywhere, anytime. I just hope for more privacy though.

### A PEN.
It can be any pen, as long as I can write or draw with it, It's something I can't go out without. Of course, along with my journal comes a pen. I need something to write with, of course. It can be any pen but I prefer the clear and inky ones, it's more easy to see and pleasing to the eyes.

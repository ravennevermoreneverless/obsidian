Just kidding, it isn't "shit", it's my blood, sweat, and tears. So why the celebration? No particular reason! Just a random recognition of how I made it this far! What I've gained: more leisure time consumer and fun things to do! What I've wasted: time, money, and ink! YEY! So here's a picture from Kuya Kim's magazine for aesthetic purposes.

It's been a fun ride, I've learned, shared and experienced many things (even beautified my penmanship which of course, I'm only proud of). I can't wait to ~~feel~~ fill this up with random junk from my brain and my life. Hope you don't get bored out of your brains, journal. Because it seems like I'm the only one getting benefits on this one! Hope you enjoy, journal. (I still need to think of a name for you.) So, **HAPPY 70TH PAGE**! Toodle-ooâ€”!

Just got back from practice... again. Tomorrow's the exan, and I haven't reviewed yet LOL. I don't really mind. Earlier, we had like a surprise Career Caravan, where we got into 3 separate buses (4 sections) and explored Pasig (not all though) just like 4 destinations. It sucks cuz all the sections sticked together but section Brahe (my section) got split in half because of our stupid adviser. It was fun, I liked the confines of the van (because it was cold af) although I didn't fall asleep. It sucks that I haven't brought earphones so I bought a pair today. Yay! (And some earrings). Everything is tiring and I'm just glad I only have a few problems left (mainly the musical play) to stress about. Before I went home, IC and I ate dinner (sisig that I didn't enjoy but I wanted to) and I had fun! Even if I payed for most of it although she said she'll pay for it but nah, I don't mind. I got money to spend. My feet are sore af. I need to rest... sleep, maybe. And hopefully, things will get better tomorrow, on Friday... or next week. I just want this to be over, honestly.

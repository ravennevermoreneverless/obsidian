Why I started this journal? Pretty simple, I didn't want my brain to explode. (Hence, the image above). I needed something to express my brain junk out without being judged or without anyone knowing. And the journal is the best and perfect example. 'Why didn't I think of this sooner?' asks myself. I don' even know, I'm stupid. I should've done this when I was younger. Now, a lot of thoughts and ideas are wasted. I didn't even get the chance of writing down my feelings. A lot has happened in my childhood (but I would be too focused playing instead of writing) so perhaps during the start of highschool, I could've recorded all the things that happened. What a bummer. I started when my life is boring and my junior year is nearing. But it's still a good thing I started sooner than later, like I always do. It's just the start of the month, more things is for yet to come and I can't wait to jot it all down and I'm hoping for more free time. And also, I wanted to be more calm and keep things (personal things) contained.

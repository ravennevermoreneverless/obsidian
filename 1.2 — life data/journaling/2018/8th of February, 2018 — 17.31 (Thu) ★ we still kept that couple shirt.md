It's another one of those 'I finally wore a jacket at school today because it's cold and I forgot to bring one yesterday but it turned out to be hot as fuck' day. (Now try saying that in one breath lol). I think it's universe's way of saying it hates me. How lovely. But when I got home it got colder than fucking North Pole here. It's so cold here that when you left ice cream on table it won't melt and it will have babies. It's so cold here that Satan is shaking. It's so cold here that Elsa couldn't even thaw (or it's so cold that it bothers Elsa) It's so cold here that even Elsa is bothered. It's so cold, you can freeze flames. Ny fingertips are freezing, it hurts. 

Anyway, earlier today, my friend told me they visited my ex's (well, not really, just M.U.) house with her boyfriend. Russel told me how she's been holding up and how she's doing. My ex made food for them. And when their topic directed to me (the boyfie's outside) Russel said she was all laughs. My ex said we are still friends and that there's no lingering issue or drama about it (even though I'm still blocked by her on Facebook). She said she still keeps our couple shirt (that toilet and poop "perfect match" and couple "ugh" shirt) and to be honest I still keep (and wear) mine. And to be completely honest, I wasn't fazed by the info given to me. I didn't feel sad, nostalgic, or regret by what we had. I just wasn't bothered at all. It's not because I didn't love her, I did, so much, maybe I just really had moved on already and I am mature about it. 

I'm feeling a litle sleepy today. But I can't sleep, not yet at least. I'll come back to you later.

I don't know why but I just feel REALLY really shitty. And I just had to write about it. It's unexplainable but it feels like a brewing fever or fire inside my body but it just won't come out. My neck hurts, my head hurts, my nasal cavity hurts. And I just feel REALLY shit. Like inside and out. Maybe it's because it's my friend's birthday and I haven't given her a gift or didn't spend time with her but I think it's more than that. I feel so overwhelmed yet empty inside. Maybe my period is coming? But it isn't due until next next week. I don't know... I feel like dying. I wanna do something but I don't have the will to do it. I wish for this feeling to leave me alone.

I feel like writing. But I don't have anything to say. I have so much in my mind but I don't know where to start. These days, my sleep is always cut short to 3 hours. Maybe it's because of the strong coffee or I don't know. And I don't immediately fall asleep. At night before I sleep, thoughts flood my mind. Like, A LOT of things. I didn't want that.

I wanna talk to someone about.. things. But geez, I don't even know what I'm feeling. I feel like going crazy. Am I going crazy? I'm going insane, aren't I? I need to get ahold of myself. Keep it together, self. Stay sane. You have a long way to go. You can't let go now. There's so much to do, places to explore, people to meet, things to experience and feelings to feel. Stay sane. Don't slip away to the darkness. You're not bound to be in the void.

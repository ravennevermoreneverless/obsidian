I will mark this day as one of the unluckiest day of my life. Actually, it's been a series of misfortune. I guess it started on Thursday or something? I thought my laptop broke. But I guess it didn't. So I'm thankful for that. But my earphones are broken. So, yeah. Shit. No music. Friday came, we went to my school to order uniform.

Well, strike one; my sizes are out of stock. So, I'd have to wear civilian to school for a week or so.. As I'm trying to accept it.

Saturday came. Strike two; I find out my name isn't anywhere on the list of sections. So, I'd have to consult the school administrator to ask where I should be. That heightened up my anxiety considering I'm already shitting myself thinking about socializing with people. When I thought things are going well, I have load, I published my story on Wattpad, I (kinda?) made friends online and things are going according to plan. I bought supplies (but still no bag, but that'll do). Almost couldn't buy those since they are also out of stock.. But me and my mom ate some good food and I bought new earphones, so that's something..?

Just when I'm gonna go sleep....worst case scenario. Strike three; my phone's not working.

My phone died. It's dead. It's gone.

Everything in there.

All the shit and stuff, gone.

My plans, my whole life; thrown into a ditch. I'll have to survive school WITHOUT a phone.

It'll be YEARS before I get a new phone. Just when I was thinking of saving up for a new phone. I need it now more than ever.

Goodbye, social media.

Goodbye, friends.

I'm having fucking anxiety and I'm fucking depressed and just moments from now, I'm close to having a breakdown. I'm trying to keep it in. I'm sweating and hyperventilating so hard.

I'm a fucking pussy and crybaby, but what can I do? That phone is like my life source. And pretty damn good timing where I need it now for school. Ain't that cute? I just hope my laptop won't give up on me soon. I'd kill myself...honestly.

So, yeah, I'm planning on going to a near computer shop later. To inform everyone and the whole world that I'm done for. And to inform my friend early that we'll just meet up at 7/11.

I'll be facing death soon, I presume. I can't sleep. I haven't been sleeping well. It's bothering me so much.. I feel so hopeless..and scared.. I need to talk to someone. Or I might go crazy. I need to sleep... maybe for a few hours? ...But nah, I'd just be wasting time.

All the bad luck is gravitating towards me. What's the worst that could happen, really? Getting hit by a truck? That should be pleasant. Like, end this now please?

Everything's just so sudden. I wasn't ready.

I'll be gone for now.....or maybe for sometime. I don't even know what will happen next. Maybe humiliation.

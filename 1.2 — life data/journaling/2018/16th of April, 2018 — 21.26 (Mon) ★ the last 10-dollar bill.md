This day started off as a pretty pissy and so dry day, unpleasant and all, topped with a scorching hot weather. And it's all because of that crappy Kapitolyo High School (mainly the teachers ehem MA'AM SANTOS ehem) but I don't want to dwell on that, it'll only sour my mood. So, despite that stressful encounter and experience, I actually had some fun because I missed my friends and they were there (and I had ice cream and stuff) so yeah. After that, I went home and slept on my bed all sweaty and still on my retro attire lol I didn't give a shit. I woke up 1 - 2 hours later, I realized my stomach was beginning its ulcer episode so I realized I had to wake up, take a bath, eat, and get a life. While I was taking a bath, I realized I should spend the last money I have because I'm broke as fuck. So I pulled out that last 10-dollar bill out of my piggy bank and said, "my last resort". So I traveled the mountains, crossed rivers, sailed the oceans and fought bad villains just to exchange the 10-dollar bill (which is a little torn on the side btw) and tada! I had 450 pesos! So I spent the 100 to computer and load and gave th rest to my momma... Aaaaand it's gone. But don't fret! I have great music in my pocket in exchange for that misfortune soooo I'm now happy and excited to open this zip files (hopefully) and listen all night. So bye!

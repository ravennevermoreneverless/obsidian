Just finished this book called ***Highly Illogical Behavior*** by *John Corey Whaley*, and I say it has been a fun ride. I think it appeals mostly to the teen readers due to the main characters being teenagers and all. The story is about an agoraphobic boy mixed with panic attacks hasn't come out of his house for 3 years after a major meltdown at school in front of everybody in that school. Now he's afraid of going outside. Not until a girl with big dreams thinks she can fix him so that she can write an essay about it to get a scholarship to her dream school and get out of that city. The main characters are Solomon Reed, Lisa and Clark Robins (Lisa's boyfriend). Solomon is gay, which is a shocker and it turned out he has feelings for Clark. It was a really emotional ride or maybe it's only on my side because I can kinda relate to him. With him being comfortable in his owm little world but I can manage the outside world though, unlike him. It was a really good read and I'd definitely would love to read some more of his popular works. ***9/10***.

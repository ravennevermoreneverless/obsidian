## Dear Past me...
I just want you to know that **you're a fucking rockstar** (this is your 16-year-old self speaking, btw.) You're a perfect little kid that everyone loves. It's such a shame you weren't "that" popular, but yeah, you're one of the cool kids. I just want you to know that you're better; much much better than me now although I'm more mature (cuz yea, you're a kid). My only wish is to relive back those days with you and feel like a child again. Although I hate you for letting A LOT of opportunities past, I still owe you so much for putting time and effort on things you like and look at how cool I am now (they say) (with an extra emotional and depressed baggage). 

## Dear FUTURE me...
I hope you make (made) the right decisions in life. I put my trust in you so much. I take it that you're living well, put behind all your regrets and mistakes (including me) and you are more mature than I could ever be. I hope you keep picking up them chicks (don't let opportunities pass) and every good show there is. Sometimes let me come inside your house and chill there or watch something. You won't mind, right? You're probably out working or doing some shit because I know I'm naturally stressed and busy. I just wanna remind you to not forget to look back at us with past me and be grateful, I guess.

It's not exactly a pretty eventful day but I got a few things and Imma make it short. Earlier at school, I felt extra confident and carefree (extra happy also). I don't know the reason to that. I've been in a good mood but I put yellow for this day. I finally let my adviser fill up the APEC form, only thing left is the Form 137, (and good moral). Also, I'm nearly done with the book I'm reading. I might finish it later today then start with another book. I slept when I got home, made my english essay about ASEAN and UN in the middle of my delicious dinner (hotdogs and tuna sandwiches). What kind of affected my mood and hurt me was the convo with my ex (Roshelyn). She said I'm not really that important to her when I asked her why she's been mean towards me. Okay, I know I've been a jerk when I broke up with her, it's all my fault but I sure as hell felt sympathy and guilt with that. She didn't have to rub it in my face that it's my fault and that I'm the reason why she's like that now. I was upset and disappointed. She was the only person I'm comfortable with right now (like my only friend with the presence I can feel right now even if we're miles apart). Turns out she's just like everybody else. The only confinement and company I have is just me (and you, journal). In the end, I would atill be alone. Nobody knows me like I do and nobody loves me like I do. It's a pretty mellow and peaceful night. I can't wait to finish reading.

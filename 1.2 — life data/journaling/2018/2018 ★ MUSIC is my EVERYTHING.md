Music.. is and always will be a big part of my life. It has unfailingly been a present element through everything.. ever since I was a child. I even remembered owning this old MP3 my dad bought for me. Ever since my dad input a few hundreds of his songs into that little device, that's when it started. I've been introduced to the most enthralling and fascinating thing ever invented by mankind. That worn-out first generation MP3 player is by far a huge contribution to my whole being, I don't really care if it's fake and all, even if it costs for only a few hundred pesos. I'd do basically anything to have it back. It's crazy how such a small digital container can make a huge impact to someone. As I grew older, it became a passion. I was so enchanted by it, it became a major component of me. Never a day goes by without hearing a song or more. I wrote down mostly every song I know or appealed to me. Then I knew, I was a level one "Music Hoarder". I first had an old tattered notebook, then upgraded to another notebook. All of a thousand songs, rewriting and skimming through it every chance I get. Then, I got my laptop.. I became a level 2: The Digital Music Hoarder. I downloaded every song in that list, and added a few new ones, and I'm still in the process. Truthfully, I never actually had a "favorite" song, artist, or whatever; it's just too many. My music ranges to a vast and diverse variety of genres from EDM to Classical, Heavy Metal to Acoustic, Japanese to Spanish, any song, really. If I find a song or artist that produces music that pleases my ears, and speaks to me, I download it and listen to it. And I'm open to every possibility. Currently, I have an organized library of 2,366 songs and counting. Sometimes, I delete, rename, add, arrange, make playlists and go through that process again. This is one of my
pride and joys and I can only share this with people special enough. Every song has a significance in my life, every song is special to me; it speaks to me. Music conveys feelings and emotions in the most beautiful way possible. It opens your heart, communicates with your brain, and touches your soul, spreading throughout your body. It lives within me, runs through my blood and coursing through my veins. Music takes me to a world where I only know of. It takes me away from reality. It is always there for me whenever I need it. It's my "go-to".

This is the last page of my journal part 2. And I'm not gonna use a black pen because it might overpower the green pen at the back page and make it unreadable. It's been a pretty boring day (I already put yellow for this year on my "year in pixels") but I didn't want to clean my (our) goddamn room, I'm too lazy. Tomorrow, I'm going to the National Bookstore to buy some stuff for school and also to check out some journals that I need to save money for. I know they're like 300+ pesos or something. I've never been this excited (just kidding) I'm hoping to put my hands on those babies but first I'm finishing this journal by the end of February. I haven't really got much time or things to write, I just wanted to fill this last page (sorry for the waste of paper and ink). This is me again signing off. Oh and look, it's Madison again for the last page, giving no fucks! How nice.

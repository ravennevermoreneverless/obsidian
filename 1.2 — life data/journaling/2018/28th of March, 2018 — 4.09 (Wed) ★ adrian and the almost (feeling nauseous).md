So, remember my ex-guy crush/classmate at school who recently knew I had a crush on him and now texts me and lowkey flirts with me? Well, he texted me like at 3 AM when I post-watched porn and post-masturbated so I was kinda still horny. We were conversing and our topic immediately shifted to sex, pre-marital sex and curiosity. I can feel the tension growing thicker and I knew we were gonna ask each other about it. And we did. And he did, he looked serious. I was shaking, my hand were cold. It was happening. We were both open to possibilities; even though he was in an open relationship with a girl from another section. That's when he asked for a time and place. He was really serious and it was really happening. I was freaking horny by that time but I was having second thoughts (deja vu atm wtf) so I kinda back-pedalled and said I'll just text him some time. When it kinda dwindled down, he immediately told me it was a joke, and he wasn't really serious about it. He then lectured me about not giving my virginity to anyone but my true loved one. And god. The humiliation. I just had to say I knew he was kidding. And that I just rode his joke. I felt a sick feeling down the pit of my stomach. I was ashamed, I felt like throwing up. My head was throbbing and spinning. I literally felt like a slut. Sorry for being open-minded? Blame my fucking hormones and my fucking curiosity. I nearly lost my virginity to a fucking NINCOMPOOP and a fucking hormonal typical teenage boy (like seriously that stereotypical jock in high school). I can't believe I stooped that low like damn. Girl, keep yourself together. You'll get some soon, don't worry. No rush. Be careful next time and keep your walls and defenses up, especially with that damn boy. I really feel nauseous because of what happened. I need to focus. I nearly crumbled and gave in. I literally thought he was serious. I mean, I know at some point, he wanted it, too. Like, we were in that topic. I can feel he was thinking of the possibilities, too. The tension was real. But I felt so exposed, so weak, so fragile and so... vulnerable. And I just had to write about it. I vow to myself that this will never happen again... EVER. And I need to think before I speak and give out too much information. FUCKING SCORPIO HORMONES. God, I really feel like throwing up. I was NEARLY a slut.

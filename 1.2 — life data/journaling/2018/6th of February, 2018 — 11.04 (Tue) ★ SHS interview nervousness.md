2 more hours and it'll be the interview. God, I'm clammy as fuck. I have like a million concerns right now. I don't even know what to wear or what would I even will look like? I purposely skipped classes to come in time at 12:30 PM. I should be getting ready by now but I figured I should write first. My mom's still not here; I haven't eaten yet, not even money with me. Maybe I'd borrow some from my classmates' profit so that I won't come with an empty stomach. Going to an interview without food is like jumping off a cliff. I might blabber (# word vomit) or mental block, something in between. I hope I don't stutter or come out as illiterate. I need to be inspired somehow and *Echosmith*'s album "***Talking Dreams***" is just the right playlist. It gives me bright morning feel and positive vibes. I can't let anything get in the way or let my mood down, I need to boosten up somehow. I need my playlist to-go playlist right now. I'm really shaking. I can't even straighten my handwriting (not like I can, really). My butt is tingling, my heart sledgehammering, my palms sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy (mom's spaghetti?). Tell you what, I'll come back later (if I still got time) to keep you updated how a fucking fidgeting mess I am. Someone inspire me pleaaaseeeeee....

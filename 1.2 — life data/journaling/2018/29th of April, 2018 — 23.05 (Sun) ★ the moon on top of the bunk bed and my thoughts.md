I had a painfully hard time falling asleep earlier today. I was very much wide awake by 3 AM and for an hour, I did something that will probably change something in myself. In the middle of the dark room, I stood up and climbed the second bed bunk which my little brother usually occupies. Since, he's not here, I opened the bedroom window and sat beside it. I let the moonlight illuminate my body and the cold night breeze carress my face. It was so peaceful and quiet, I can almost hear the steady breathing of my brother on his bed. I felt so calm and unafraid. I felt at peace. I looked up to the sky... it wasn't too dark. It was light indigo and with clouds of fog capimg almost half of the view. The stars are barely shining but the longer I stare at it, the stronger it twinkles. The moon shined so bright. It was almost a complete full moon because it is the end of the month. It was so beautiful, too beautiful. The moonlight is the only source of light in my room. It was just me, the night sky, and dense thoughts swimming in my mind. It's almost half an hour when I laid down on the bed, still facing the sky. That's when it got deeper. I stared at the stars and watched intently. It twinkled harder than earlier, and one by one, hidden stars that weren't there earlier started to pop out. The harder I scrutinize the stars, it's almost as if I can see the lines connecting them like shooting stars. And it's almost as if they were trying to tell me something. For a while, I stared at the stars. Then, I took notice of the moon. It was so white and so.. alive. Brighter than ever, brighter than any moon I've seen. There's something about this moon that left me in a state of awe. I felt bare and naked under my layer of clothing. I felt the need to spill my secrets, my problems and questions in life that I don't realize my eyes are spilling wet trails of subtle tears, flowing from my cheeks to the bed sheets. I wonder, does the moon know? We are all under the same moon and sky, I wonder what my friends are doing at that exact time. My family. My soulmate. My ex-friends and ex-lovers. Random strangers that I haven't met. And does the moon know? All the deepest secrets a person could have and nobody could learn? Does the moon know? If I hadn't made these decisions in my life, would I still be here asking the moon this? Why am I even here? What's my purpose? Why do I exist? How do I live? Who am I? Thought after thought spilled that night I didn't realize it's been an hour. I climbed down the bunk bed, lied down on my bed and put music on earphones. And 2 hours after that, after several twist and turns, I finally fell asleep.

A glass of hot chocolate Swiss Miss and spaghetti is what calms my nerves this morning. I didn't get much sleep last night, I was too busy updating my journal. Here I am, writing on my TLE class; we're doing nothing. And every time someone walks in, they think we're (I'm) doing something important. It's funny how their face scrunch up in fright and asks, "What are you doing? Is there homework to do?" Then I just laugh. They're pretty paranoid. Now it's just 3 of us, well, actually 4 now. But still nothin' to do and 11 minutes to go. Now there's 5 of us.

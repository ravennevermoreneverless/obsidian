These days I realized I haven't been beautifying my journal like back then, how I was so obsessed with making my journal aesthetically pleasing but now? Geez, I could care less. I just do what I do (or sometimes I'm just too lazy to do shit LOL.) Earlier today I got into a heated argument with my friend Roshelyn. She judged me, called me immature for thinking I don't actually care with other Fifth Harmony members just because I don't care about pointless issues. I don't know if she's aware that she's contradicting herself MOST of the time then gets angry about it and blames it with everyone else. I usually keep my cool but geez, I don't know but is it just me or her stupiditiy just increased ten-fold? I can't deal with that shit no more so I ain't talking to her until she keep her head and morals straight before she drives me crazy. I don't know if it's just me being an ass or are people becoming more and more stupid every day that passes? 

Today I read a book about SOULMATES, KARMA and REINCARNATION. I've always wondered about these things especially with soulmates and this book opened my mind to many possibilities. It made me open-minded with things that limit me from thinking like a modern rationalist's view of reality. 

I've learned that each religion possesses part of the truth and it is up to us to piece things together to form a whole. I realized that unless we are able to transcend narrow and self-limiting religious boundaries, it is impossible to see the whole truth. The limitations imposed by one box and the militant keepers of that box will prevent us from examining other boxes. The Bible is the collection of books by different authors formed into one book. Therefore, not every single article is shaped perfectly as is for the Bible is arranged and re-worded, examined by many many priests for people, centuries and centuie that pass. 

I may be a little skeptical and doubtful of these beliefs, due to my still rational thinking and endless possibilities but I'm on my way of shaping, and growing myself. There is so much more to learn and yet I'm still so far from the truth of life, universe, and everything.

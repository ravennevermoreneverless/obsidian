So I had a panic attack today, and I think this is the worst one yet. So I was worried about Rafa being outside, I was worried about what might happen to him so I stressed over how I should search for him and get him back and the constant paranoia of something might happen to ME. And I said YOLO. I searched for him, didn't find him, then the neighbors told me he might be im our other neighbors' house so I went back inside with fear, worry, guilt, and doubt weaving inside me, stirring me up along with stress and paranoia. The next thing I know my heart is palpitating, I couldn't breathe, my hands are shaking, and my knees are buckling. So I took deep breaths. It didn't work. I'm feeling sweaty and filled with anxiousness so with wobbly steps, I went to the kitchen to drink water and went to the bathroom to take a cold shower to clear my head. Just when I was nearly done; my most feared to happen happened. A loud continuous knock filled the whole house... and I was naked. I was shaking uncontrollably while dressing up, my knees are shaking I might fall and my breath is erratic. After a few seconds, the knocking ceased. With a sudden glimpse of bravery, I peeped outside the balcony to see what it was. And my neighbors saw me and exclaimed they saw my cat. So with shaky steps, I went down the stairs, got my cat, and thanked them. With another series of shaky steps, I managed to get to the house without falling. And I am relieved. I'm still shaking but I'm thankful the cat is inside now and I'm thankful my friend is with me on the text. God, Rafa was so hungry. I'm hungry, too, but I can't... I don't feel like eating. I don't want this anymore. Someone, please come home before another knock resonates.

You know those random bathroom habits; may it be good or bad, that you can unconsciously go through (even with your eyes closed)? I've had my own set of those. Let's start with the toilet. I have this random habit where I was the toilet seat first with water, wash my below parts with water, rinse the toilet seat again with water, and the floor surrounding it, then flushing the toilet, then rinsing my below parts again; opening the faucet first before sitting down on the toilet then "finally" pooping? But I actually don't poop immediately. I prolong the pleasure of dumping my shit for a few minutes before actually doing it. Then before washing my butthole, I close the toilet lid first... it's weird.

Then on to the showering. I have this habit where I put soap first, like, which body part first. The sequence goes like this: left arm, neck, torso, right arm, back, lower back. Then cut to that. Before I do my below parts, I rinse my lower body part first, rinse the soap first, then wash the remaining parts. It's weird, like, it would bother me if I volunteeringly don't follow this routing, it WILL really bother me. I don't know, just some stuff about me lol.

So, you know how I drank coffee, right? And then I thought about things... especially the friendship issue with us 4; me, IC, Kristine, and Jellai. And I fucking analyzed it (I mean, I've analyzed this wayyy back the start of school year and this is the only time it all connects and in comes the supporting details). I don't know if I've figured it out or I just over-analyzed things but here we go. 

It all started with that fake-ass scumbag who gullible-ized me. I think DISHONESTY and SELFISHNESS are the roots of this crumbling excuse of a friendship. I know it's obvious that there's an undeniably big barrier that we put up and still haven't broken down that stops this friendship to be completely called a "friendship". The tension is there, we don't say anything about it because we're dishonest, we don't solve it because we're selfish then it leads to distrust. Let me explain one by one.

I'm gonna start with the easiest; IC. IC.. is one fragile naive girl. She's sensitive, going through an identity crisis and has to be handled with care. She needs someone to support her, lift her up through it all and she thinks it's me and she relies herself to me and that is her problem. She isn't being honest to herself and to everyone else with her feelings for me and because of that, her selfishness of wanting to stick with me and stay by my side blocks the possible solution to the problem. Hers is the most basic one but it can be fixed with maturity and more sense of wisdom.

Next is Kristine. And I perfectly described her in the previous entry/rant. Like I said, she is egoistic and self-centered. She isn't honest because not giving a fuck is way cooler than dealing with them. Her selfishness gets to her head and it prevents her from creating good relationships around her and she's just bringing the pain to herself; like digging your own grave with shades on. I don't know if her attitude is inborn or family problems but I know the latter is a huge factor with her toxciness. I can't fix her if she can't fix herself so it's better to just detach before I go insane about it.

Third, is Jellaicah. Where should I start with this girl? Oh yes, a fake-ass two-faced lying plastic bitch. Rude if rude but it's the truth. Lying is her talent, being manipulative is a special skill and desparately doing everything to get what she wants is her biggest pet peeve. Oh yeah, and she's C-R-A-Z-Y. And it makes me CRAZIER because I still stick to her. She's NEVER honest, PURE selfishness, and every nasty shit combined. And FUCK ME IN THE ASS, WHY AM I STILL HERE? I need to find a way to slowly let her down. Or if worse comes to worst, Imma drag her plastic ass outta my life.

And then there's me. My biggest problem is that ironically I run away from my problems. I think it's the worst one yet out of all of us. It's like I dig my own pit, jump in it then t try to get out, hoping for a better life. I mean, what the fuck, me? I'm probably the craziest out of everyone. It's what causes me to be dishonest. And I'm selfish to think that by keeping it this way, things will be yippy handy-dandy flowery sunshines and bubbles and happily ever after. I just want a fucking restart button for all of this but I also know I won't function with life without them. I might fight fire with fire although I'm still fucking torn. 

Together, we form the greatest team of fucking up a bomb. We are all dishonest and selfish. We are all brewing up a storm, collecting it and locking it inside a safe, thinking it'll be gone forever until Pandora opens it and hell breaks loose. We're all fucking cowards for not wanting to risk our friendship thinking that it feeds our little "perfect" delusion of what friendship actually is. And I'm like in a fucking burning house. I want to cut the connection to all my possession, get all of what is essential then get the fuck out, if they can't do it, before I get suffocated by the toxic fumes and die.

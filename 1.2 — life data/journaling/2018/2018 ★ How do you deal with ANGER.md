I feel irritated, annoyed, frustrated a lot of times by little things. But extreme anger? Like hatred for someone, something? Not so much. What does anger actually mean anyway? I think being angry is feeling flames piling up inside your body, like a time-bomb ticking and you just wanna...EXPLODE! I don't think I've dealt with powerful emotions such as anger, but the closest I can be to being angry is being extremely irritated. I sometimes can be irritate just by literally nothing or just random things. And when I do, I can be pretty harsh with words. Or sometimes I like to be violent (very rarely though). Some ways I vent it out by sleeping (no.1 go-to), eating, listening to music, a cup of coffee, and also, writing my feelings in the journal. Sometimes, I want to cry out my frustration but for some reasons, I couldn't so my throat would just get hurt and something would just be stuck there. I don't really explode... like those people with anger issues. They should learn to control them... because it may lead to death (by killing) a.k.a. anger management. To prevent them going all hulk and smashing everything they see or going bull like destroying every red they see (which is a myth, by the way).

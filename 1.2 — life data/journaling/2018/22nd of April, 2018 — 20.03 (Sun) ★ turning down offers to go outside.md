It's a Sunday, and I'm home alone again. With my coffee. Not even our cat is here. He wanted to go outside. I don't know what to feel or do, honeestly. I'm not motivated or inspired. I'm not even hungry or hyped; not even the coffee helps. I just feel so empty and... lonely. Don't get me wrong, I love being alone. With my music and art and books but today is just... different. My depressive episode is acting up again. I was supposed to go to church with an old friend of mine, he invited me but I didn't want to go outside because I'll be all awkward. So I made an excuse. My mom offered to go to Makati with her so that I wouldn't be alone and I declined, as well. I just... didn't want to. I'm thinking would my day be better if I has accepted the offers and go outside? Or I would just have to deal with anxiety and panic attacks while outside? Would my day have went better if I accepted? Would my day have been better if I opened that loud knocking at my door even when my mom doesn't want me to? Or my day just got affected by the sad Camren videos or the sad music I listened to? I wish I know and understand myself better. I need someone to talk to with this. But I don't have anyone. I feel so lonely.

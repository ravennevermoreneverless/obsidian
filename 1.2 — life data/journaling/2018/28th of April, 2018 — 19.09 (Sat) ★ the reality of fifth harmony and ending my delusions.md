The guilt in giving presents. You know that feeling when you feel guilty because your present may not be good enough or someone's gift may be better than yours? That feeling never does vanish. And I think it's the suckiest feeling ever. 

Each of my favorite song has a significance in my lifetime. Like 2012, I have a certain set of songs. 2013, 2014, 2015, and until now. It's like a Pop Dathology of my life. It's hard to keep up and remember all of them but I'm trying my best. You know it's illegal to download music without buying it, right? For me, it's really unfair (or it's just my selfish self speaking.) Music is a beautiful thing that can be enjoyed and shared with everybody for free. It's crazy how people see this as a form of business then make profit out of it just because everyone enjoys it. It's crazy how nothing is for free now. Even being yourself isn't free, you still have a price to pay. Not even freedom of expression or freedom of being accepted. My only crime I've ever done in my whole life (and probably continue doing it until the day I die) is illegally download music. I'll forever find a way to do that. 

I wanna talk about Fifth Harmony and how I feel about everything. The issue of Canila leaving never bothered me at first, for I became a fan a year after she left. So, I went and stanned them (the OT5 version of them) and I remembered hating the fact that they're 4 and Camila is successful. But I kept stanning the past and never the present. It satisfies me and feeds my selfish unrealistic views of everything. Especially with Camren. Their friendship back then is so special and I certainly, very surely believed that there's attraction there somehow. And I was stuck... in the past; where everything is perfect, happy, and succesful. I am happy that they WERE happy. It's only 4 months into the fandom that I realized. It all dawned on me. Reality slapped me like a bitch and shouted to my ear, "Hey, that is 6 YEARS AGO! Face the music and stop livinf in your sea of delusions!" I opened my eyes. It's true. Reality is where there are 4 girls in Fifth Harmony. Realityis where Camila Cabello is a successful solo artist. Reality is where Lauren is happy with her relationship with Ty, and Camila might just be with Matthew. Reality is where the 4 girls are finally gaining much attention individually. Reality is where Fifth Harmony is on hiatus and Canren might just not be real. I've laid out conclusions, ideas, and possibilities thag Camren WAS real. WAS. Past tense. Past. Who knows if in the future, it'll happen, but for now... I'll just let them be and be happy for them. I'll try and not get emotionally involved too much and be affected as much. Because it's their life. And I haven't got a say in this. It's hard but my grip is slipping, and I'm keeping myself together because it's tearing me apart.

Same goes with Girls' Generation. Ah... my fandom, for what? 4 years? That's a lot to take in! I know it isn't much compared to other dedicated SONEs who lasted from the start until today and forever will be. But I guess I have my limit. I'm finally and officially taking a break from K-Pop world. Maybe I'll check up on them, support them from time to time and maybe be a fan again in he future. But there's so much more out there that I haven't discovered and I don't want to cage myself in one thing forever. It's been a fun ride, Taeyeon, TaeNy, and SNSD. But I'm afraid the roller coaster is coming to its stop and you're now just part of my teenage life.

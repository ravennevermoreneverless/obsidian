It's just a normal weekend, woke up at 2 PM, unexpectedly went out on a date with mom. We ate ice cream outside, she treated me burgers and bought salted eggs. I think Pateros is a wonderful place where humanity is still alive. We went home after. Folded the clothes, listened to music and I finished ***Sweet Nothing***, a CamRen fic; which is good btw. I drank coffee and I can't wait to do things I love to do. I suddenly felt aesthetic again and inspired. I'm home alone at the moment, my parents and my lil bro are talking with the neighbors downstairs (with coffee, not alcohol) and it feels good being alone once in a while. 

P.S. Scorpio facts on the internet are so accurate, it's startig to get scary but it amazes me at the same time.

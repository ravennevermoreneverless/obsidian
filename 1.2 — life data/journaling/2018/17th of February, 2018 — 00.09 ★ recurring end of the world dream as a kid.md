12:09 AM, February 17th, 2018. After snacking on some chips (Chiz Curls) and had a good time, some things are missing. My laptop charger, my internet, my brother, and charging place. I've grown tired of reading my book for today, so it just left me, my mind and my music to ==wonder==. I mean do you ever just wonder what could happen if the sun explodes? Stars die and turn into scattered gases floating around the universe. What would happen to us? Y'know, I have dreamt of this same dream when I was a kid EVERY NIGHT. The same scene happens; the sky is dark and has flashes of orange across it, people running around with panicked faces, cars, buildings, streets on fire, and then there was me trying to find my family "until it's too late". What do you mean too late, you say? Because in that dream there is this weird string. Like just a random screen flash of string slowly breaking; like when the thread is slowly losing hold of the other. Then accompanying that is (are?) loud noise(s) that gives you headaches. It was so loud, but the loudness is like only in your head, almost like the noise(s) were trying to say something. So, it led me to the theory that it might be the future; the one written in the bible how the world would end again. First, the super blue blood moon's appearance. Second, the explosion of Mt. Mayon. Maybe some other phenomena and the last one with the sun's destruction and explosion; people dying with its flames. But then again, it's just a theory and we don't know if it'll happen unless it actually does. But I personally think I'm part psychic so... who knows? I can maybe, kinda, can see the future.

Music on (***Human*** - *Christina Perri*), the night's almost in the middle, everyone's asleep, dad's drunk, mom's at work. I'm in the middle of messing with my journal, (kinda aiming it to be semi-art/semi-fun) since I've got all the time in the world and just a little something to keep me busy. I have journal goals I'm aiming. I'm really progressing and I'm impressed. I hope I don't run out of ideas soon, I'm enjoying killing time updating my journal. My journal is mixed whatever the fuck kind of journal I want it to be. Though I seriously need to buy some stationery and I seriously need to get some sleep because 5 hours from now, I have classes. I should also start starving myself (to save money) and study hard at school. And I should get ready for my interview for senior high school on Tuesday, god I'm nervous as fuck. I should also go get some shut-eye. Bye, goodnight, journal.

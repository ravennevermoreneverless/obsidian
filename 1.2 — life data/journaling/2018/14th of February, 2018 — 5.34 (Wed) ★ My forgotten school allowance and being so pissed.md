It is February 14, Valentine's Day. It's just the start of the day yet I'm already having a bad day. Excuse this page if it needn't any decorations, I just need to vent out and calm myself down. First off, what the fuck. My brother went to God-knows-where without leaving our school allowance. I have to use my fucking savings which only amounts to 44 pesos and I'm fucking hungry as FUCK. And I had to loan load from SMART for me to be able to call him/my mom so I owe them 28 pesos now. And GODDAMN, I AN so FREAKING PISSED. My plans are ruined. I was so tempted to not go to school but I remembered that fucking JOHN lettering. I am so frustrated and annoyed. And I won't be able to buy them flowers for I haven't got anu money. Fuck, they owe me 200 pesos. Fuck, JESUS. And second of all, what the fuck. I am fucking hallucinating and I'm dizzy as fuck. I don't know if it's the coffee or the lack of sleep or the hunger but GODDAMN, I am seeing and hearing shit in this house. I'm disoriented, shakened, frustrated, confused and shit! I don't fucking care if it's V-Day or not, fuck the occasion, the assignments, the report, I AM SO FUCKING PISSED. 40 minutes of waiting for my school allowance and I'll be going, hopefully I will calm down later on and things will get better (or worse). Inhale, exhale. I'm calm for a bit now. I'm gonna talk to you later. Bye.

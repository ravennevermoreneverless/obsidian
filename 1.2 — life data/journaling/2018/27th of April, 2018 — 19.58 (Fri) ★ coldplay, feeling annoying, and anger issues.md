It's a pretty uneventful day and I'm listening to Coldplay; on a Coldplay marathon. And I say I'm pretty much digging their songs. Why haven't I listened to more of them sooner? Well, anyway, I wanted to talk about how I feel when giving information about myself. Err.. how do I put this.. You know that feeling when you think you're being too annoying by giving out too much information about yourself and you know they don't even care so you backtrack a little bit and shut up even though you're too excited to talk? I feel that every time. I don't want to be the annoying talkative person so I just sometimes keep it all to myself. I really REALLY want to talk about a lot of things, truthfully speaking. I want to talk about everything and anything with someone comfortably, without restrictions and you understand each other. I think this is why I'm obsessed with this soulmates thing (the soulmate complex) because I think with a soulmate you can experience those deep fulfilling conversations and it must be nice. It's hard to find someone that thinks in the same field of wavelengths as yours. Where you just connect and... God, I can't wait for that. 

Also, one thing I really want to talk about is my anger management issues. I don't know if my lack of communication and human interaction affects how I handle my own feelings but I can't seem to control my anger if it's present. It's like I shake violently in anger, and I try so hard to contain the rude and hurtful words that will come out of my mouth so I would just blabber and stutter random incoherent words that I can't seem to form meaningful and rational sentences. My mind clouds with anger and flames. I need to learn to control this. Maybe it's because I try do hard to be patient tha I don't realize that I bottle everything up and then when it's full, I just explode. I always think of myself as calm and collected or maybe that's what I want to be but in truth is that I am a deep and intense person. I feel so much and I'm much sensitive... overly sensitive. I just don't let it show. I really have got to control this shit. I might die with it. LOL. 

Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll continue lsitening to some more Coldplay music.

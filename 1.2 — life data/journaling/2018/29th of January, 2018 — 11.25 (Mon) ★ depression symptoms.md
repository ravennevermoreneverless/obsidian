It's been a cold and hot slow day. Nothing much had happened at school but one thing's for sure; I missed hanging out with my bestfriend Jaime. I feel like, no wait, I KNOW I've been neglecting him for some time now and I regret that. I sometimes even feel like I'm too guilty to even face him but somehow I'd like to change that. I'm feeling extra giddy today because my aunt's package got here today and I got new perfumes and food to eat. Plus. I found my bro's headphones and powerbank. I even got this cool binder journal for free. I got spag for dinner, I was happy today but felt a little sentimental today because of my conversation with my other friend Isabella. I somehow let myself spill the fact that I'm depressed. I didn't want to say it, I didn't want to open up but it spilled. It made me think of stuff. I'm not special, neither is anyone but I don't feel like I can relate to her at such levels. I'm not gonna judge how depressed she is. Being depressed is different than believing you are depressed. And honestly, I don't know which state I belong to. I just stick to those "symptoms" and "signs" I found on the internet. Here I'll list it down for you (for future purposes, I guess): 
- persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood
- feeling of hopelessness, pessimism
- feeling of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness
- loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies, and activites(including sex)
- decreased energy, fatigue, feeling, "slowed down"
- difficiulty concentrating, remembering, making decisions
- insomnia, early morning awakening, or oversleeping
- low appetite and weight loss or overeating and weight gain
- thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts
- restlessness, irritability
- persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment such as headaches, digestive disorders and pain for which no other cause can be diagnosed
I don't know about you but I'm experiencing every one of this symptoms and it is NASTY. I didn't ask for this, I want to have a normal life (wait no I guess not) I want rather, to go back to my previous life where things were a lot more simpler and easier. I want to go back watching anime in my room, collecting merch, going outside playing, drawing anything and everything, playing with the guitar, watching TV, and playing music. I'd give anything to bring that back. Things changed **drastically**. And I'm here listening to ***life sucks**** playlist with ***I Won't Give Up*** by *Jason Mraz* on play. If things hadn't changed, I wonder what I've been doing lately or right now.

I was about to sleep when our topic drifted to my aunt's arrival and us going to Makati. My dad requested to buy him a cable for charging then mom said she'll pay for it but when I was the one who requested on buying a cable cord, she said why can't I find a way to buy my own stuff. I don't understand. And then the topic drifted to giving favors to our aunt so that we get rewards in return. They keep saying we should win their favors (*bolahin*) so that we get money. Then, again, they compared me to my little sister and little brother; how they are always the ones running errands and how my big brother is so hardworking and studious and that I should be like them. And how I shouldn't say "I didn't dream of this" (quoting what I've said in the past which I don't ever remember saying but I regretted it). God, they just can't understand, do they? That I can't be like that, I just can't... I can't bring myself to do it. And I can't promote myself for doing good in school, working hard, giving my money and time and effort in studying but they don't see that and I can't justify because the school system is unfair, life is unfair. This is a sensitive topic to me, personally. Being the weirdest, most unkind, lazy, irresponsible family member ever created, now, I don't feel like going there by Sunday. They just can't understand, no one does. I try my best to be good; I struggle, but whenever I do they can't see that because they are clouded by the ghost of our past, my dark self and they forever engraved that picture of me, even when I grow up. And the thing is, they don't know how to help me. They think they do but giving negative mindset, discouraging words, salty and bitter words; never compliments. And now, as I was writing this, they misunderstood me, again. I can't believe this. Now, I can't go to sleep. Are they happy now that I sank to the lowest of the low? I hope they know that they made me like this.

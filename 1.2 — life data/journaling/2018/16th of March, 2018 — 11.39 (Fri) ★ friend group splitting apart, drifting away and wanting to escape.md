I went home without notifying my friends (well, except for Louie, of course. He's always with me.) I just really didn't feel like it. I didn't feel it. There was this unwanted tension and uncomfortable feeling between all of us, I can't shake it off. Our original group as you can see, has already split up. From Richard, Francesca, Harold, Faria, Erika, Jhen, Jaime, Louie, Jellaicah, IC, Kristine and me to just Faria, Erika, Jaime, Jellaicah, IC, Kristine, Louie and me... we're now having different worlds. We can now tolerate each other by just walking past one another by the school corridors, awkward smiles, small talks and that's it. And I'm not even speaking terms with my best friend (I don't know if I should call him that anymore) Jaime. And it's happening again with my friends now (Jellaicah, IC, Kristine). It's getting uncomfortable. You know that feeling when you're slowly losing hold of one another that it's just... meh. I just want this to end, get this over with, and start anew. I know life doesn't have a restart button, but I would so much exchange my prized collections to restart my life. I don't like this. I don't want this. I feel like they're not my friends, they're just temporary. In the end, I only have myself. Indeed, high school friends remain in high school and I would like to keep it that way... if only... My current friends are toxic to me (I can see that), they're not good for me, and I don't even know why I still remain with them. I should add this to my future self, to pick better friends and get rid of toxic people. 

Oh, and at school? God, the people there... I just wanna get out of there. I might come off as a bad person (rude and anti-social and all) but I just can't keep up with their stupidities and attitudes. GOD! Why did I even go there? Everyone is the same... Even the teachers! I just seriously want out.

I am scarred for life. Here's the story. I expected myself to be alone until the wee hours of the morning. That wasn't the case. My brother arrived home around 1 AM, his girlfriend in tow. It was kind of awkward but I said, 'hey, what could go wrong?' And apparently, I was wrong again. By 4 AM, I was hungry, so I got up (my brother was up) and so I made us some meatballs, deep-fried and some rice. Everything was cool and all, we conversed happily over food until 5 AM. That's until later on, I wondered why the upper bunk of the bed is too squeaky and moving. The sun was almost up and it illuminates the room. That's when I saw the shadow. Two nasty boogers fucking at the top bunk thinking they're subtle. Oh god, why am I always experiencing the humiliation of catching my relatives fucking? Now my brother? Oh god, my innocence. I'm scarred. How fucking dare they? While THE sister is at the bottom bunk? Shameless hormonal fuckers. Go do it in the bathroom or something. My rotten luck, seriously. I have a knack of witnessing those. I was in the middle of reading a fic when that happened. So, I just closed my eyes and pretended I was asleep to save them from humiliation of realizing they weren't really subtle. Thankfully, my mom came knocking at the front door and they had no choice but to stop this canoodling, which I was very grateful. Ugh, never again. It's so disturbing. Now, I realize I'm also grateful my friend's plans of coming over didn't suffice. It would be too damn awkward later on. Shame on them. It'll never be the same.

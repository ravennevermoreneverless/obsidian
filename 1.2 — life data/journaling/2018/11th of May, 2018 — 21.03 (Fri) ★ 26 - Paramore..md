This song... perfectly describes my mood right now. Just listening to it; a vivid collection of events and sceneries flashes through my mind and it makes me feel things. The lyrics might not be related to what I'm thinking but the music and the flow of the song sure do. I feel like I'm underwater. I'm not drowning or panicking, I'm just slowly sinking, calmly letting the pull of the water consume me until I'm at the bottom. I feel like I'm sprawled on the living room carpet, hair all over the place and just staring at the ceiling. I don't feel like moving. The sound of my beating heart and my respiration is the only thing I can hear. I feel so empty and dull and just... lonely. That's what the song says to me. Emotionless. Blank. Paralyzed. Unwilling to move. Breathing but not living.

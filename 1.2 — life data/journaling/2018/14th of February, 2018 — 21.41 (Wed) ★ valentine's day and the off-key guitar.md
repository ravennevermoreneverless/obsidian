Hi, again. It's been a long day and I was hungry when I got home. One word (or wait, 2 words) for this day; GEOMETRY DASH. I'm officially addicted with the game yet again. I installed Lite, Meltdown, World and the latest favorite: Subzero. Not to be cocky but I personally think I'm getting much better as I play more. But anyway, it's Valentine's Day but I'm pretty fucking mad for almost the whole day (same reason as earlier) and my brother is yet to come today. No one sells flowers and V-Day goods at school. And because I'm an ugly-ass fucker and no one loves me, I picked myself some flowers (from the hallways). I don't know what these are called but they are cute and can be found at the 4th floor of our campus. I might search for these in the internet or might as well ask the school staff/gardener. 

I suddenly had the urge to play the guitar (but my guitar's out of tune (off-key)) so... maybe some time in summer. And I need to start reading ***Freaky Friday*** and finish it by maybe Saturday, it has like 160-something pages then I have to start reading some other book (God, how I love reading!)

Bye for now. I've made up my mind that Imma put red today. And I only got like 100 pesos from my mom today (hopefully another 50 tomorrow). I'm still pissed. And btw, are boys naturally lazy, immature, and irresponsible? This is why I'm leaning more to girls.

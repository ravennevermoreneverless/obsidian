I'm so nervous that I can't even stay put for a second so I figured I needed to write here to calm down, and I'm really clammy and my palms are sweaty. I know I can do it, I trust myself for being myself (nailing it) but I'm just afraid I myself isn't good enough. Oh my lord, help us (lol) I don't want to come out as trying hard to them so I didn't review much. I hope I can answer the questions nicely and with class and I hope I don't sweat so much (since it'll stain, I'm wearing dark blue shirt) I'm gonna eat now to fill my tummy, let's get this over with!

Just got home from the interview. It was so tiring, we had to wait for *hours* (because I'm the last one). Thank fucking God, that's over. I didn't get to print the pictures because we just got home and I kinda don't have the money with me hehe. Surprisingly, I didn't get all hungry at all (maybe it's because of the nervousness). You know why we were late? It's because we didn't bring a parent. My friend Jellaicah said that APEC said it's not really required for the parent. She sent me a 'copy paste' of their convo. I'm not judging but I was stupid enough to not notice the suspiciousness of that. Why not send a screenshot rather than the 'copy paste'? I've always been suspicious of her, for our whole relationship. I can tell when she's lying and she lies A LOT. I'm not gonna feign ignorance because it's pretty obvious. I don't even know why we're close friends. And because I'm her friend, we should talk about that issue soon... For now, I don't know. I want to pretend nothing's wrong and hopefully, change that trait of hers herself. The interview went well though, it was pretty fast. I forgot the majority of the questions asked. Yeah, I do that post-nervousness sometimes it comes back, sometimes it doesn't. I'm just really REALLY glad that's over. God, this social anxiety's gonna be the death of me.

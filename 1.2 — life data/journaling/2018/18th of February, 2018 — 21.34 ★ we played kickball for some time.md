It's bed time but I drank coffee so I won't sleep yet. I haven't been updating my journal for a while now (like 2 days now) because the laptop charger is still not here. Yesterday, I painted a wig tree using oil paint and that's just basically what happened yesterday. Today, I finished 1 book (I finished ***Freaky Friday***) and it was good. And I played outside (for the first time since forever) we played kickball; we played for some time, the adrenaline and excitement cursing and pumping in my veins that when I kicked the ball, it went flying to the roofs and popped so I gotta replace it. I showcased my drawings (again) to my neighbors' kids and I don't know, I felt weird and tingly. I won't be sleeping anytime soon though. I was going to share my weird dream earlier but I forgot what it was about, I just remember it was my older brother and his sexual abuses (weird huh?).

So, yeah, I should save more so that I would buy more stationery (and the next journal) or I would ask mom to buy some for me, I don't know. And I should probably bullet journal soon and work on morning pages.

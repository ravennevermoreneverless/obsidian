A long day indeed. I'd put light blue or green, I don't know. First off, I went to school and like we didn't have electricity so no classes for the first two subjects. At english, we bough 10 pesos pens when actually we can buy those kinds of pens for 6 pesos (?) advertised by that old man, (brilliant marketing). By Filipino, we were all chill, everything was chill. By P.E., we did cheerdance jumps and hand gestures (I even executed one) plus points and excitement because my crush was there at the court as well, maybe, watching us perform. By science we didn't do shit, then by math time, we were oriented for tomorrow's values information. "NO SEMINAR, NO MOVING UP" such bullshite. And then no phones, it will be confiscated until April, another load of bullshite. So, yeah, I still have to go tomorrow (without the parent, gonna tell them white lies). When I got home, I was dizzy as fuck (maybe because of the heat wave, the coffee at ministop or me hungry; or maybe all of them). 

By evening, I had a good talk with my mom (mostly me talking) from horror stories to what is her college life, and my grandpa's passing. When my dad arrived, the talk prolonged. Mostly about my childhood and how much I remembered when I was less than 1 year old. I remembered so MUCH and I found out they were all true! I will tell you by the next article (my childhood). Then we looked at my baby pictures (God I was so cute back then). How shitty my current school is, my new school and how I need to do great to impress the school. (I can tell by my dad's lowkey proud of me and damn, how that felt good he doesn't necessarily show it though) and his hatred for Ma'am Santos. Seriously I think every person in that school was brainwashed (including me). I'm so glad I snapped out of my fantasy of that school and looked at the real world. I can now see how shitty the school itself actually is.

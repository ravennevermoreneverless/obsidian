As part of being a teenager, I'm a fan of different things like bands, movies, artists, or people but there are just few that is considered my main fandom, and I can count them with only one hand. And when I'm a fan, I devote my whole life; my blood, sweat, tears, time, money, effort (I practically worship them at this point). First, there is Girls' Generation, the no. 1 K-pop girl group ever. Okay, look I know I'm gay when ever since I was elementary but this got me even gayer like damn. I've been a fan ever since Grade 7 or first year of high school. At first, I despised and hated K-Pop with my whole heart (because I was taught that K-Pop and anime are completely different worlds and sworn enemies, I don't know why, don't judge me lol). And then I searched for some music videos of it and then I got sucked into the girl power fandom. I gor addicted to it because of my obsession with *Kim Taeyeon*; my love, my life, my everything. And then came next my OTP#1 TaeNy, and then SNSD. I listened to every song (downloaded, lyrics and all), I watched every video (from music videos to variety shows), I saved pictures (from every member to the whole group), I read fanfictions (mostly with my OTP) and I admit I ate my words when I said, "K-Pop sucks" (my 6th grade self). I was obsessed but I didn't complain and didn't regret shit, I was happy and inspired. Okay, that was in 2014 and it's 2018 now. I became a fan in like June? So yeah, it's nearly 4 years. It sucks because I became a fan right after Jung Jessica left but hey, I was thankful I got spared from the heartache. It didn't discourage me from being a fan, in fact, my love for them grew stronger by the second. They are (hands down) the best thing that ever happened to me and I will carry my love for them until I grow old. My goal in life is to meet them; especially *Kim Taeyeon*, in the future. I also want to thank my bestfriend, Kaye, for introducing them to me. Every song of them is my favorite song but I'm gonna list down the **songs that lives in my heart** (in alphabetical order):
1. All My Love Is For You (one of the first songs I listened to)
2. Baby Steps
3. Beep Beep
4. Blue Jeans
5. Bump It
6. Do the Catwalk
7. Everyday Love
8. Fire Alarm
9. Flyers
10. Goodbye, Hello
11. Green Light
12. Indestructible 
13. Into the New World
14. One Last Time
15. Only U
16. Talk Talk
17. Whisper
GG apparently became the road for me to the world of K-Pop. My eyes became open to the diversity of K-Pop groups and I became a K-Pop fan like any other NORMAL teenage girl would (straight or not). I listened and watched to different K-Pop groups (even downloaded some of them) though I never bought merch cuz I'm either poor or I think it's just a waste of money. I focused mostly on watching and listening and had my eyes on groups in SM Entertainment. Life was good. K-Pop is another element to my adolescence. 

Another thing that gave me life was **ANIME**. Nothing can describe what impact anime gave my life but one thing's for sure; it's MY CHILDHOOD. I was only a year old when I was exposed to anime. Bad parenting? I think the hell not. I thank the heavens for letting me watch anime at such a young age. My first anime was Samurai X (*Rurouni Kenshin*)and I can still remember clearly **that** certain episode. It was that time Kaoei was abducted by that creepy man with a straw hat, red bloodshot eyes (he did drugs) and black side face. Kenshin was in that house, tryna save Kaori and then that guy (along with his buddies) was gonna fight him. And then the creepy dude, put his fingers inside Kaori's mouth (like deep inside her mouth) then she choked and fainted, I think. Kenshin was furious (T-R-I-G-G-E-R-E-D), and that's all what my one year old mind can handle. From then on, anime was one of my interests when I was a kid. I binge-watch anime for a living. I watched ***Zenki***, ***Ah! My Goddess***, ***Blood+***, ***My Melody***, ***Mirmo de Pon***, ***Sugar Sugar Rune***,  ***Azumanga Daioh***, ***Yakitate Japan***, ***The Law of Ueki***, ***Zatch Bell***, ***Yamato Nadeshiko***, ***Zero no Tsukaima***, and many more! But then I cam across ***SHAKUGAN NO SHANA***. And holy fucking shit I got addicted. And my love for anime strengthened. We were kinda poor that time and I only watch anime on everyday channels on TV and God knows how I finished Shakugan no Shana. I was so obsessed that I wishes I was Shana and I had my own Yuuji. I don't know why bu for some reason, I didn't really like *Naruto* that time. My parents earned more profit and our grandma's house that we're living in will be demolised so we went to a different house (where there's Wi-Fi) and then I was exposed to MORE ANIME. That's where ***Fairy Tail*** comes in. I kinda left behind SNS and got tired of it, in cam FT. This one was seriously a huge impact. I watched every episode there ever was, memorized every song, played every game, bought every merchandise, drew the characters (I was obsessed with Erza Scarlet) and everything. Fairy Tail WAS my life. I learned to read manga that time and read my OTP fanfiction. That time I was exposed to gayness (I was 11 - 12 years old). My first ever gay shit is Erza X Lucy. I was straight as hell and read Natsu X Erza, Jellal X Erza, Gray X Erza, God knows how I got there. That was also the time I was exposed to smut reads and *hentai*. I learned to read and watch other animes, too. Mangas like ***Shitsurakuen***, that wolf boy manga that I can't fucking remember the title, ***Dragon Drive***, ***.kite*** and other shit. Animes like ***SAO***, ***Shingeki no Kyojin***, ***Sakurasou***, ***Ano Hana,*** ***Another***, ***Death Note***, ***Angel Beats***, and many more. And I loved their music (openings and endings). 

Because of anime, I got exposed to the music light of anime; **VOCALOID**. It's basically music with anime, I was like yey, why not, right? Vocaloids are singing bots that you program and make music with. Then they create music videos for the songs, and I loved it. (I was obsessed with *Hatsune Miku*), their songs, the Vocaloids, the music videos and everything. Especially *Negitoro* (Luka X Miku pairing because of the Magnet song). I read fanfictions and *Doujinshi*s for that; and a also a few of their songs. It kinda gave me ligh through the dark days. Vocaloid introduced me to *OSU!*, an online rhythm game I got obsessed with. I play it every single day and it enhanced my eye and hand coordination fast skills. For some reason, I like rhythm games like *Beats*, and *Project Diva*. Vocaloid also introduced me to *Nico Nico Chorus*, *Miku Miku Dance*, and *ROBLOX*, a game I got addicted in playing. Let me list the **songs I loved in the Vocaloid family**:

So there, I lived for those until now; they are a part of me and made me what I am now. Look at what I've become! A nerd! I should've added the Youtubers (Smosh, Pewdiepie, nigahiga) because I got addicted to them at some point but I won't add that since I just binge-watch all their videos but not actually in the fandom. 

Now recently, I entered a new fandom. I discovered Camren (but seriously they've been lingering around for a while but I just didn't care) that led me to Fifth Harmony and (OMG) Lauren Jauregui. Camren became my OTP#3 (OTP#2 is *Negitoro*). I was leaning more into Western Pop and broadening my knowledge with Hollywood, how nice. But just like being a fan of GG, I became a fan right after a member left; Camila Cabello (Cam in Camren). Only this time, a year has passed. And just like GG, the departure is messy and still a lingering drama and feud (which I think was caused by management, FUCK the management). It's kinda sad because I think the girls all have such good friendships, it's disappointing. But that won't stop me from being a fan. Leaning to Western fandoms is a change, kinda hardcore because both fandoms are so different from each other. Koreans are more conservative while here, they are pretty bold, so it's challenging for me. I have to adapt to different climates from time to time. But yeah, I just got here and there's already disbandment rumors, great timing. But hey, as long as I enjoy it, I don't really care much. I don't really have anything much left to say but I just wanna say Camren is real and I fucking love Lauren Jauregui. Both are facts. 

**These are the songs that made me fall in love with them more** (but I still got a lot to listen to so I might update this soon): 
1. Who Are You
2. Bridges
3. That's My Girl
4. Miss Movin' On
5. Gonna Get Better
6. Write On Me
7. Don't Wanna Dance
8. Them Girls Be Like
9. Dope
10. Angel
11. Lonely Night
12. Can You See
13. Squeeze
14. 1000 Hands

So, these are my main fandoms (as of now, February 3, 2018). I might add some later on, get addicted to other stuff life has to offer so yeah, let's all see how it goes and I'll write it here. Ciao~

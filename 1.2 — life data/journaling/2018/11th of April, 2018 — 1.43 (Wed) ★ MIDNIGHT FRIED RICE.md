So, earlier I had a really terrible stomachache (probably my ulcer acting up) so I made myself my own "midnight fried rice" (midnight because I made it on midnight lol.) So I ate it and it was DELISYOSO. After I ate all of it, I washed the dishes (because my siblings are too lazy and too immature to wash the dishes, I just did). Then, I took a bath because I was feeling sticky and I brushed my teeth. Now, my siblings are gone, Idk where they are so I'm just here memorizing raps. Oh, and my tita, she called me eccentric. Oh, and me and Isabella went out to eat at 7/11 earlier (her treat AGAIN). And here's the recipe for "midnight fried rice":

- 1 pc. garlic, chopped
- 1/4 cup shredded carrots
- small chopped onion springs
- 1/4 cup white onions, chopped
- 1 pc. sliced ginger
- 2 cups of white rice
- 3 tsp. worcestershire sauce (IDK the spelling lol)
- salt & pepper to taste
- italian seasoning
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- AND THE SECRET INGREDIENT: ***my mom's tuna sandwich spread (1 tbsp.)***

What a slow and hot day; worst days in my opinion. It's mother's day, yet no mother to be found. It's the start of my red days, yet no napkings to be used. The extreme discomfort I'm feeling right now is incomprehensible. The scorching heat outside, the nauseating stench of the cat's (a.k.a. pooping machine) third poop already and my stomach's neverending complaints. I can't focus properly because I'm uncomfortable and I'm home alone again. Everything would've been fine if they left me some money or something, seriously. I woke up very early due to a strange dream now I can't sleep for I worry I will stain my new bedsheets due to my period. I need help. Send help. If the clock strikes 3 and nothing changes, I'll kill myself. This'll be the last time.

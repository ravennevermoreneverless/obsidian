I just woke up. Yesterday I bought this journal along with a few stationeries... I haven't been able to write on my old journal and I have trouble keeping up. But hopefully with this ==new journal== I can be able to keep up. 

Yesterday went by a blur because it's super tiring. There are a lot of tests that happened that I just half-assed because I didn't review. Then I exchanged my 40 dollars that my aunt gave me to pesos then I bought random shit lol this money won't last long with me. I just knew it. I got my haircut on Sunday, and a **lot** complimented me because of it. They even said it's like my crush's haircut but I didn't mean for it to look like that tho! I swear!

I got a shit ton of things to do at school but I kinda don't want to do the musical play, I'm so done with school and I just wanna get outta here goddamn. Can we just end this so we can go? Geez. This is the last hell week for this year and I'm thankful, I just want out.

My tita is leaving this Saturday and I wouldn't get anymore sadder. Time flies by fast and we can't stop it. I'm really thankful for all she's done and gave us. And the weekends spent with my family is something that I can't replace. Unfortunately, I'd have to wait until next year for it to happen again (and to get a new haircut, as well). It's a bummer that I can't be absent on the school days because it's nearing the periodical test. Bad timing. So, yeah. It'll be long before it happens again.

Saturday and Sunday has been very eventful. Saturday, we went to *Okada* and *City of Dreams*. We watched the dancing fountains and in CoD, I was BORED AS FUCK! I regret not bringing my book. But hey, at least I got 500 pesos! On Sunday, we just chilled in the condo. I got my haircut (yey). We ate snacks at the pool and talked and laughed. Then went to Starbucks (my usual strawberries & cream) then went back, played Uno. Then watched movies ***Get Out*** and ***Jumanji***. I was so bloated, I need to exercise, seriously. Bye!

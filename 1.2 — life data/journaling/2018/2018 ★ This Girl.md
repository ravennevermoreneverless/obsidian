Her name is Julia. Julia Marzan Almaria and she's my biggest crush yet. Sure, I've had crushes, one of them (also named Julia) was the largest one (4 years, I think) but this one is definitely the strongest and pretty hard to let go. I really really really REALLY like her. Look, I don't know why, okay? Maybe it's because she's pretty? Or because she sings exceptionally well or can bust a move with passion? Or maybe it's because she plays the guitar really good and good at maths? She's almost perfect, for me personally. This crush gave me a hard time moving on (she's still my crush as of this day). I've had 2 romantic relationships already and she's still my crush. And when I got someone I like, I don't obsess over them or stalk them, I just... like them and respect and admire them from afar. Maybe chat with her from time to time when I got courage. The perfect song for this would be "Crush" by David Archuleta. It describes my feelings to the highest level for her. She has noticed me, yes, and gave me her attention but she doesn't like me that way. But of course, the hopefulness is still there and I can't shake it off. It's my last year here today, I mean this year, at this high school and this is the last year I will be seeing her (as she will be seeing me) I'll miss her, will she miss me? It will take some time to move on from her but I know I can manage. Besides, it's just a crush! ...Right?

If there was something that I regret in life, one thing for sure was staying at public school when we went to a far away location (Kapitolyo High School). Maybe I was being immature, ignorant, or I was just completely clueless of life when I was in 8th grade. I admit I was stupid (in that aspect and in making that decision) that time. Well, until now since I'm still stuck here. Now I'm dealing with different kinds of shit right now. Friendship shit, poor quality no class school shit (not literally), worn-out facilities and sucker teachers, rules and regulation; I despise all of it wholeheartedly. Why did I even remain here? How can they choose to even be here? Perhaps they have the same reason I had; stupidity and naivety. If I had just went through that chance of going to a private school, maybe I wasn't as stupid or inexperienced as I am now. I blame myself for being afraid of having culture shock or a change of peers and environment. I wasn't strong enough and nobody was there to encourage me to push through. Now I am stuck here in this filty mudblood (muggle-born) made school with their filthy mudblood studies and stupidities and I can't afford to let them influence me and my fabulousness. I can feel I am slowly becoming one of them and I could NOT let that. This is the first time I've seen a school that doesn't appreciate education. Maybe there are more out there, I wouldn't know but for the love of Mary, it is awful. But anyway, if I were to remain in a private school I would have added to the expenses and financial problems of my mother so I think it's just good that I chose to remain. I got friends, yeah, but few only are decent.

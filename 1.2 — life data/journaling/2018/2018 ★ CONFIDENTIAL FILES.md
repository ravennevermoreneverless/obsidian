Nobody knows that I secretly like being complimented. It makes me feel happy and it boosts my confidence. I secretly think I'm Japanese though like somewhere deep inside my ancestors, I have a Japanese relative. And nobody knows that I like it when they say I'm Japanese or a "not Filipino". I don't know, maybe I don't like being a Filipino at all. Alright, I admit. I'm an ungrateful piece of fuck. Y'all can now judge me, yeah, yeah. Also, nobody knows that I.. um.. (okay this is embarrassing even though you're my journal and you're an inanimate object, I still feel embarrassed, gosh) I masturbate on a pillow. Okay? I hump on it. Whenever I get horny and turned on. You can't blame me, okay? I'm a teenager and I have hormonal urges, it's part of life! Also! I don't like sticking my fingers inside! I personally think it hurts! Aaaand nobody knows that I had sex (well, almost?) with our housemate when I was a kid. This is one of my worst nightmares and deepest secrets. I wasn't really.. forced to do it? But I didn't resist. Maybe it's because I was naive, a child and is curious about things. I haven't told this to ANYBODY. Absolutely no one. So I trust you with this one, journal (I should probably give you a name soon). Actually, nobody knows a lot of things about me, it's either because I'm not really open much to anybody or I don't really have that much close friends at all (I'm a lonely person). So, yeah, that's mostly just it.

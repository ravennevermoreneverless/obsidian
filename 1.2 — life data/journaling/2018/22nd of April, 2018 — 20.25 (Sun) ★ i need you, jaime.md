I miss you. I just miss you so much. And I can't do anything about it. Everyday I live in this constant guilt and shame mixed with self-loathing because it is me who put us in this dead end. Everyday I apologize to you over and over again in my mind, screaming for you to come back. God, please come back. Take me back when it all used to be so happy and content and it's just you and me. It hurts. It fucking hurts. Do you know how it tears me apart thinking about those times when we used to just sit on the sidewalk at night and talk about everything? Do you know how it fucking crushes my heart when my mom asked about us and I just had to lie and say we're okay so there won't be any drama? But do you know how it fucking feeds on my soul that I put you in so much pain than the pain that I'm experiencing right now? It hurts more thinking I turned my back on you when I know you needed me the most. I love you. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry because I couldn't help you, especially when I couldn't even help myself. I need you, Jaime.

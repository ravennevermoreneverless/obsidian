I did most of my to-do list today. Though I kind of fell back asleep in the morning while listening to an album and reading a book. Also, I remade my Twitter account and turned it into a Japanese (art) account. I followed a bunch of Japanese people and some of them followed back. I'm gonna use it to talk in Japanese about random stuff that comes to my mind that I am able to say. I can't care or complain about the following-follower ratio at the moment because my Japanese is very limited. I don't want to sound like a fool in front of these people. Also, I'm wondering what's better for a Japanese journal: handwritten or digital? I was thinking of writing in both ways but that's just a waste of time. So maybe digital, like I've been doing with my current journal. It seems easier. Also I realized something. The reason why I couldn't keep a routine was because I was still reluctant to actually fix my life and commit to it. Having a routine means I'm taking steps to get my shit together and a part of me didn't like it. That part of me wanted to stay miserable. I mean, if I actually wanted to, I could have my act straight. I'm the only one holding myself back. Anyways, tomorrow, I'm thinking of coming back to my Instagram accounts. Staying out too long would pile up the shit I have to do to keep up with updates. I still haven't given up on my archive account, you know, I have a business to run. So yeah.

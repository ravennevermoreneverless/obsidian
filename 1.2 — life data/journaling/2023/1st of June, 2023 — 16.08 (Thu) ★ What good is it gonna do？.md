You know when certain things just don’t give you that certain kind of rush again? Like, for example, stalking CJ’s (and Renson’s) Spotify account(s). Or when CJ views my Instagram stories. It’s not as addicting as before. I feel so bland about it. It’s like I’m thinking ‘*what good is it gonna do?*’ I can’t bring myself to be excited thinking about her again. Sure, I still look for it, but only because I’m expecting that rush to my head again. But there’s nothing there. I feel like an empty husk now that I don’t have those feelings anymore. It’s getting so old, I need something new. Dear god, it’s been years. Though I should be glad that my feelings are changing, right? Ever since I talked to Renson, everything changed, like they fell into place. I’m not even craving for a reconciliation with my former internet friends anymore. I’m losing the yearning part. I am now yearning for different things. College life. Meeting new people. Hanging out with friends. Just experiencing anything new again. I need that. I desire that. I’m so excited for what life has in store for me, I really can’t wait. I’m ready to let go now, of old feelings, of these obsessions, of guilt and nightmares, of these sources of dopamine rush. Or I might just be depressed.

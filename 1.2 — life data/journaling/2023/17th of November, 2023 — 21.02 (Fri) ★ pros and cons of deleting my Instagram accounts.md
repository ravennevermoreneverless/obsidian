I didn’t sleep today because I wanted to use the laptop early. Also, my sister decided to stay up late again to cram schoolworks so the lights were on, there’s no way I could’ve slept. I need to speak with her about that soon. So yeah, I impulsively read a book called ***How to be an Adult*** by *David Richo* in one sitting while taking down notes because I had the sudden urge to figure my shit out and sort it out, and perhaps fix it, so that’s what I did until 5 in the morning. Right now, I’m using the laptop. Earlier I was typing down tarot card meanings but I got too bored with it so now I’m doing nothing. I think I’ll just spend the rest of today thinking and writing down my thoughts (while listening to music, of course). I’m not gonna study. Not like I have the mental capacity for that with my sleep-deprived brain. Oh yeah, I had 5 new large pimples on my cheeks, just ‘cause my sleep schedule got fucked for the past few days, so there’s that.

I have this huge urge to delete all my Instagram accounts (except for my art account maybe). I am currently weighing the pros and cons. 

PROS:

1. I wouldn’t be anxious about my account getting deleted for copyright.
    
2. I wouldn’t yearn for other people’s lives.
    
3. I wouldn’t compare myself to others.
    
4. I would save so much time doing better things.
    
5. I don’t have to worry about updating anything anymore.
    
6. I wouldn’t get the urge to post any personal stuff online.
    
7. My attention span would increase.
    
8. I can do literally everything privately, without the prying eyes of people.
    
9. I will be able to appreciate each moment and savor every second of it.
    
10. There’s no point in having an online presence.
    


CONS:

1. Being disconnected from the online world.
    
2. Not being updated with my “friends” and their lives.
    
3. Not seeing memes, art, or weird shit that I like.
    
4. You won’t be able to meet like-minded people with shared interests.
    
5. Severing the last mode of possible communication with my former internet friends.
    

  

COUNTER ARGUMENTS FOR THE CONS:

1. I can still be connected to the happenings in the world by looking at trusted news source.
    
2. My “friends” can still message me on Messenger (and maybe Telegram, if they want).
    
3. I can leave my art account as the only means of still being able to see memes, art and weird shit by following those weird people on that account.
    
4. I have lived with that for years, I can return to that life again, no big deal. I don’t really think I benefited from that anyways since I never talk to people, probably won’t ever will. Plus, there’s Reddit and Discord for that.
    
5. It’s been long overdue, don’t you think? I won’t remove them on Spotify though.
    

  

So yeah, I posted a poll on my private account about this and so far only one person voted (he voted “no”). I guess some of them wouldn’t really care if I disappeared. Earlier I was worried it’d take time to save all the photos and videos I’ve posted to my phone but I found out Instagram has a “Download Your Data” feature so I don’t really have to worry about that. I have about by the end of today, or at least before my birthday, to think about it thoroughly. I will lose nothing. Am I robbing my future self of having meaningful connections? Many people didn’t have social media and still managed to live a fruitful social life so I wouldn’t worry about any of that.

I mentioned I wanted to figure what the fuck my problem is and I wanted to work on it. I listed down what I think the problems are (spoiler: there’s a lot) so I’m gonna go in-depth with each of them, I guess. 

First, is that I keep **running away** from my problems, confrontations, and people. I’m talking about Lou, what happened with my former internet friends, my current life situation with our dog. With Lou, you know how it went. I found out I fucked up, I hurt her without knowing, countless times. And what did I do? I asked to take some time off away from her, deleted my Telegram and all that shit. We just view each other’s Instagram stories but I guess that’ll be gone soon. But yeah, I just ran away from it instead of talking things out with her. I got overwhelmed, I was ridden by fear. I may have feared having to confront a side of me that lay dormant inside me, something I wasn’t consciously aware of, but unconsciously avoiding. But most of all, I feared the voice inside my head telling me it’s perfectly okay to end a 4-year friendship just like that and just erase the past. I convinced myself I wouldn’t come back unless I knew what was it I did, because how could I ask for an apology if I didn’t even know what it was I was apologizing for? I could do it again if I’m not aware. So, that’s partly the reason. But the main thing is that I only wanted to run away from it, to detach myself from the situation, not deal with the consequences. That’s exactly what I did with my former internet friends. With them, I assumed the worst, and instead of talking things out, I cut them off, convincing myself that I needed the time alone to think and figure my shit out, same with what happened with Lou. While it was true that I got overwhelmed and I needed time by myself, maybe cutting them off was not the best decision. I could’ve talked things out. But instead I ran away, like I always do, because I didn’t want to deal with it. The same with my current life situation where my dog is too hyperactive and noisy that all I want to do is to run away to a place where no one knows me, where I can have peace. When can I have the peace that I so desire? Until when will I stop wanting to run away from everything? Until I’m completely alone and isolated? Is that how I want to live my life and to die? I am aware that the only thing to do is to suck it up and communicate with people. There I said it, the solution. To talk. Something I never ever want to do. Or wait, do I desire running away because I want something to change with my life? I keep saying I’m content the way I am right now but I would be lying to myself, wouldn’t I? I don’t want to leave this here unsolved but I can’t think of anything else to do, really. Right now, I’d much rather prefer a life in complete solitude. Even if the loneliness would kill me.

The next thing I want to talk about is **limerence**. It’s been such a major part of my life for the past few years. I have talked about this in detail in the past and why I have been limerent over my ex-girlfriend so I’m just gonna talk about what I feel now and the current situation. I still have my ex and former internet friends as mutuals on Instagram—and I don’t know why I still keep them, or why they still keep me even though they never interact at all. Well, I guess I know my reason—it’s that I still hope for a future reconciliation with them. Which is obviously a really bad idea, because (1) I’m still not over my limerent feelings over my ex, (2) I’m a heavily insecure person and they shouldn’t be involved with me at all anymore so interacting with me would mean I have to have figured my shit out by the time we meet, (3) it would mean I’d have to own up to my mistakes and admit I fucked up and so talk to them, which is something I am unwilling to do and I don’t really think it’d be worth it at all. But really, the most significant reason is the first one so there’s that. Selfishly speaking, the only kind of reconciliation I’m thinking of is with my ex, but that’s because of my limerence. I haven’t imagined it with my other former internet friends at all, not Louise, not ate MJ—just CJ. Currently, I haven’t stalked any of CJ’s accounts for some weeks—not her Instagram nor her Spotify, so that’s good. I still want to finish that animation though so I’ll keep working on that, even though I’m still just starting (and I wanted to redo the first scene). The more I talk about these issues, the more convinced I am of deleting my Instagram accounts. 

**Emotional detachment**. An issue that’s always been there but only recently has been brought to light in my current life. I don’t know love. I don’t know how to give and receive love. And because of that, I suffer frequent bouts of unbearable loneliness. Is it because of fear of intimacy? Of pain? Is it because of my upbringing? The lack of affection as a child? Those might be the reasons and I think I’ll allow myself more time to figure this one out. Preferably without involving people so that I wouldn’t have to unknowingly hurt them. This is obviously a deep-rooted issue and it cannot be solved in just a day, a week, a month, a year. It might even take a lifetime of learning and self-discovery. That’s something I have to do alone, without the risk of hurting others. So bear with the loneliness a little more, I promise things will work out.


**Manic depression**. The demon I’ve only given a name to just several years ago. The demon who’s always been there, who never left my side. And no, I’m not gonna romanticize it. This demon only means harm. It disguises itself as someone I can rely on when times get really dark, even though it’s the sole reason why everything’s in the darkness in the first place. That demon is me. It’s a part of me. And I can never deny that anymore. It’s inside, it’s a part of me, that can’t be separated. And instead of denying its existence, its identity and how intertwined it is with mine, I’ll accept it. I’m not at all saying I agree with the chaos it wreaks. But I acknowledge it, I see it, I understand it, and so I accept it without judgment and attachments. Eventually I will learn to coexist with it, because after all, it is me. I wouldn’t want the demon to create hurricanes and tornadoes anymore but it is my duty to keep it in its place. Better mood and behavior management. More self-awareness. And I’m determined to do exactly just that.


My **passions**. Something positive for a change. For the first time in my life, outside a manic or depressive episode, I had something I wanted to do. I have goals and plans for the future. It’s learning the Japanese language so that I would be well-equipped and prepared to live in Japan. But first, I’m learning to pass JLPT N1, to get the certificate, and potentially become employed as a Japanese-English translator for the mean time, while I’m still here. That’s my ultimate drive at the moment. That’s how I look forward to waking up everyday. How I keep on moving. Yet it’s making me wonder sometimes if I’ll ever be good enough. If my goals are valid. Am I being a burden by staying at home, cooped up on my desk, studying my ass off? But you know, thinking about it, as I do it, it doesn’t really matter if I’m not good enough yet currently, because I know I can always work hard for me to become better. And I know that this will bear fruit someday, it just takes time and hardwork, which I’m more than prepared to give. But I also fear I’m being attached to these desires and passions. It makes me think: what would my life be without it? If Japan stopped existing, would I lose my life’s purpose? I cling to the hopes that this would never happen but really, who knows what will happen in the future? All I can really do is focus on my present, and do what it is I love to do, which is to learn, and consume art. And even if my goals become impossible to achieve? I’m sure I’ll manage to find another one. I’ve been there, I can do it again.


After careful contemplation (like an hour or two) and a quiet plea from one of my followers, I decided to keep my archive account and my art account. I’ve grown attached to my archive account. I used to consider it my safe space, and it still is! Why should I delete it if somehow people actually benefit from it? So I’m keeping those two. But I have already downloaded and uploaded my data from ravenotnowsky to my Google Drive, so I’ll be deleting that one. Goodbye, semi-friends. Goodbye, new mutuals. Goodbye, personal life updates. Goodbye, former internet friends. Goodbye, CJ.

It’s afternoon. I had nothing else better to do. I talked a bit with my sister about anime. My racing thoughts were apparent because I switched topics quickly. I took a shower. I’ve decided to stop using the Kojic acid soap everyday. Just maybe twice a week this time. I’ll settle for simple soap and water. I wrote down the recipe for *Oyakodon* in a new notebook. Then I redid the first scene of my animation. I’ll be sleeping early today. I feel a bit sad. Well, not a bit. I’m really down right now. I’m mourning and grieving for the lost hope for future reconciliation, something that I’ve been secretly desiring—I’m taking conscious steps to remove it from my existence. I already had my account scheduled for deletion on December 17th. This is really goodbye now, huh? After years of recurring dreams, persistent daydreams and wondering why we still chose to stay. But this time I’ll be the one to cut the final cord. See you when I see you, in the next life, maybe.

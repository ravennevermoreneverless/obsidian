I'm not gonna sleep today. I fucked up my sleep schedule again. I woke up at 2 PM today (and I drank coffee past lunch) so I just know I'll be awake until after midnight, so I'm just not gonna sleep. I already drank 2 mugs of coffee, and I reserved another 2 packs. I just studied Japanese today, that's all I've been doing. I posted a recording of me speaking Japanese on my Instagram and somehow, that made Jia (the other one) unfollow me for some reason. I'm not gonna act like it didn't bother me (it did) but I was just surprised. Maybe she thinks I'm not worthy to speak Japanese? Or something, haha, I don't know. It made me think about my former internet friends. What makes them still follow my account even though I already cut them off? They never view my stories, too, anyway, so why? I saw that CJ liked a post that was posted a week ago, then that means somehow she opens her Instagram. Does she have me on mute? Or she's just avoiding viewing my stories (because she doesn't care)? Anyway, it would be the same case with me, because I don't even know why I still have them as mutuals. Why do I keep following their accounts? I mean, I know I'm not gonna meet them anytime in the future, so why? I guess I'm just waiting for them to be the ones to unfollow. I just know that would break my heart because of the shock, but it'd pass eventually. Why won't they unfollow me? It's been long overdue, don't you think?

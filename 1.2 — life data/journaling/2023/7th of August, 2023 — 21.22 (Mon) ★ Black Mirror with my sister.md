I slept at 3 AM today and I woke up at 6 AM. I immediately got coffee and listened to 4 hours of music. Then, we started cleaning me and my sister’s room. With the help of our mom, we arranged our things in a way that the room feels more spacious. I got a new desk. It's actually a vanity table but I made it into my study desk. Afterwards, I took a nice shower after a long time of not showering. We bought burgers and ate them while watching *Black Mirror* episodes (with my sister). We’re still watching *Black Mirror* right now. I practiced a bit of Kanji for *Genki* Lesson 20. It really does feel like my life has turned around ever since we cleaned our room. I feel so fresh. I’m more pumped to do stuff now. 

Earlier I kept thinking about spending time with CJ in real life. I imagined she would find me attractive if I took my mask off. And if I smiled. I’m so fucking delusional that I am daydreaming even when interacting with other people. I’ve hit a different kind of low now. I posted on my Instagram stories and I still can’t help but keep checking if CJ (or Jia) has viewed them. I know terribly well I should not fucking care, I am terribly aware of that, and yet I still check obsessively and impulsively. I really can't help it. 

Anyways, I’m really thankful for today (also the fact that my phone’s battery doesn't get drained as quickly as I’m used to). It’s like life can actually be good.

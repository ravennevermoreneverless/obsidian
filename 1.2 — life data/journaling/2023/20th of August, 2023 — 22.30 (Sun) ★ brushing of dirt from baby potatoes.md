I woke up early as intended (6 AM) and immediately started listening to music. I stopped near the end because my mom ordered me to brush away the dirt from the baby potatoes. Then, I went straight to studying. I finished 2 units and I was taking the unit test for linear equations and functions but my brain was overheating, I had to stop and call it a day. Just then, a random bright idea came to me: a weighing scale to determine how stressed I am (because I have this thing when I start, I can't stop). I made a replica of a model I found online then tweaked it a bit (I don't have plywood so I made it out of tape and folders). It was a lot of work, not frustrating though, and it was super fun. The end product was wonky and jerry-built (it's literally falling apart) but I really had fun making it even if it's in the heat of the moment (and I am hypomanic). This is a prime example of enjoying the journey rather than the end goal. I don't think I'll ever frequently use this silly contraption at all but I'm still glad I did it. I read a few pages of *Haruki Murakami*'s ***A Wild Sheep Chase*** but stopped after, I think, 30 minutesâ€”I couldn't focus. I can feel my tremors coming so I ate dinner even though I said I wouldn't. Now I'm sleepy. I still have 1/3 mug of coffee left. I'm excited to tackle that linear equations and functions unit test.

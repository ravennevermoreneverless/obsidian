I thought I'd be able to have my phone's battery replaced today but my dad's salary was cut short by his company. I don't know how long I'll be using this barely functioning phone but I'll have to make do with what I have. I basically just slept the entire day. Our electricity was cut because of some maintenance but I was too asleep to even feel its inconvenience. I woke up around 5 PM. I can't even listen to music in this phone anymore while opening another app, it drains too much battery life. I just finished taking down notes for my Japanese studies, which is a win since I didn't feel like moving at all. In terms of what I currently feel, I just feel empty. It feels like I went through another breakup with CJ, even though nothing happened and we're still not talking. It's just.. I feel this sense of loss, for some reason. Like there's something I can never have back and I'm mourning over it now. They say grief isn't linear, I think I agree. It's been more than two years of grief and it still feels like it only happened just yesterday.

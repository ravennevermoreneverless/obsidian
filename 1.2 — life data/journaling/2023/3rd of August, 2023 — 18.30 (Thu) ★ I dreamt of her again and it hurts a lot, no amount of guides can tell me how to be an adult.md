I dreamt of CJ again. I don’t have much to tell you because I don’t remember even half of it (thank god). But I do know it was me stalking her profile and a bunch of other posts (or archived stories for some reason) suddenly can be seen in her profile. I went through everything, I couldn’t focus on anything else. I saw she posted pictures of me back then, and all I can feel is this sinking feeling. I woke up, still having that sinking feeling inside of me. Sometimes, it turns into a gut-wrenching suffocation, but really it just sinks deeper and grows emptier by the second. I would think coming back would solve things but no. So, I’m going to remind myself again: I’m never going to reconcile with my internet friends ever again. It’s just like my high school friends, I should treat them as such. They were people I’ve been connected with at some point in my life and it’s time I let go of these attachments. They were a part of my life. And that’s just it—a part of it, not the entirety of it. I just.. it just hurts so bad. There is no way to move around the hurt, I have no choice but to let it hurt, for a while. I’m not even sure if they’re mourning the same way I am right now. But does it really matter if they aren’t? Maybe thinking about it that way would help me ease the pain. I am tempted to deactivate (or delete) my personal account again but what good would that do? If it’s to stop myself from viewing my ex’s stories and see her posts then I could just not log onto that account. I should limit my usage of Instagram.

Today is Thursday and I’m using the laptop. I was supposed to be studying but I took a little (long) break. It’s hard for me to focus for long periods of time. I already arranged my study schedule up until October. Well, it’s more of like a to-do list for every academic topic, plus my programming and Japanese studies. I should probably get back to it soon, I just wanted to write down my thoughts as the sadness has been too much.

I’m thinking of different ways to document my life. I’ve always thought my Instagram would be a great tool to keep photos and videos of memorable events, the problem is that people will see it and I am still thinking about them perceiving me, especially since I don’t have it in me to unfollow my former friends. Now, I’m thinking I could use Google Docs but that would mean I would have to post the videos somewhere and then just link them here, which won’t work since I would still be posting the videos publicly. I think I’ll just do what I usually do: post memorable events on Instagram, and then post mundane stuff on my stories. 

I should really get back to studying.

Yeah, nope, I can’t study anymore. I’ll just listen to some music and think.

##### ***Did I do something today that I can be proud of?***

— I guess one thing I can be proud of is facing my sadness and confronting the root problem, even if I’d done it before. I’m not running away from it this time, and I’m learning not to run away from it again. I am starting to let go of my attachments to the past and I’m proud of that.

##### ***What is one thing that I am grateful for today?***

— I am grateful that I took small steps onto achieving my dreams. I studied for hours today. I’m grateful that I have a laptop to use. I’m grateful that I have access to the internet and that I could listen to music and write here. I’m grateful for that always.

##### ***Did something happen to make me sad?***

— I think I’ve always been sad, even if it’s not on occasion. Even if I seem like I’m happy and content, I am sad. I guess I’m just used to it. Or it’s a depressive episode. I don’t know anymore.
  
##### ***What would I say to them if I could see them again?***

— Nothing. I wouldn’t even spare a glance… or at least that’s what I want to do. But knowing me, I know I’ll give them a smile and ask how they’re doing, like the fake fuck I am. Why can’t I just act and speak the way I want to?

Enough of these boring prompts. It’s annoying that I go through them like some kind of question-and-answer game, I don’t really think about them for much at all. I’ll try again some day, maybe one question a day or something. Right now, I want to talk about being an adult. How the fuck do you even become an adult? Sure, you hit 18 and you’re allowed to drink now (even though I was already allowed to drink at a very young age) but fuck, no amount of guides, or articles, or blog posts, or Reddit threads can answer the question of how. Everyone doesn’t have their shit figured out and we’re all just winging it. If you have your life neatly laid out before you and you actually know what you’re doing, then, well, congratulations, you’re one of the lucky privileged ones. Let’s take a few moments to breathe before all goes to shit, yeah? And maybe share some of that optimism? Actually, no, you can keep that. Too much optimism could do me more harm than good. I think I’ll survive with a healthy amount of pessimism… plus some cigarettes and gallons of coffee. Oh yeah, I’ve picked up smoking again, after more than 2 years, possibly nearing 3 years. I don’t know why. I mean, I don’t want to die yet, but it feels like I am slowly contributing to my death by smoking so that’s good. It’s a good alternative for suicide. I know I’ll regret this in the future but I don’t care right now, I just want to live my life.

Maybe now’s a good time to write down my long-term plans? Okay, so I have 385 days before I go to college on August (probably, but I do believe it’s on August). Right now, I’m investing in myself by learning Math, Science, Programming, and Japanese. I already have my schedule laid out on a Google Sheet file. So, yeah, there’s that. That’s basically my long-term plan for now. In college, I am pursuing Multimedia Arts in University of Makati. I don’t have other options yet. Oh, I’m thinking of applying to UP with the Talent Determination Test. I think I’ll try that.

I didn't sleep earlier. I listened to music around 12 midnight to 6 in the morning. Then, I studied Japanese until afternoon. I fell asleep around 2 PM and forgot to do calisthenics, again. That sucks. Well, at least I finally got back on Japanese again, I’ve been slacking off. I dreamt about the end of the world again with raging storms, massive earthquakes and landslides, planets hitting Earth. My family and I rushed to another place as there is an imminent explosion near our house. Thunderstorms are looming, too. Sometime later, I got (voluntarily) crushed by stones and debris from a mountain landslide but I got out of it because I was panicking and suffocating. Later, I discovered I had flying superpowers. I flew across the sky freely, discovering places. There are some kind of recharge stations for my flying ability. Kanola also discovered she was more than labels and being gay and non-binary—she was everything. She discovered she had flying superpowers, too. We flew together through the night sky, we had so much fun. I also dreamt I had new Spotify followers and CJ had completely new playlists, all of them about me. Obviously, that's what I secretly desire and hope for but that’ll never happen.

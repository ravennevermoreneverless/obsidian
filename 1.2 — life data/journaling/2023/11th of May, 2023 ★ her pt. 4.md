1. ***What do you want in a future partner that you didn't have in your past partner?*** Communication. Vulnerability. Emotional Maturity. Trust. 
    
2. ***What does the word “heartbreak” mean to you?*** It means rejection. Like you’re suddenly unwanted and undesirable by your object of desire. Grieving over a future you thought you were meant to have. 
    
3. ***Looking back, what did you dislike about your relationship?*** I hated the fact that I was anxious all the time. How she would disappear for days and never tell me what goes on in her life. It's like I’m in a relationship with a pretty wall. My questions that were a bit personal were always met with indifference and aversion. I hated that.
    
4. ***What were some of the more negative behavior patterns in your relationship?*** She was never vulnerable with me and I was always anxious and obsessive. She was always running and I, chasing after her. The cycle repeats.
    
5. ***What's something you've always wanted to do, but didn't because of your relationship?*** I wanted to be able to tell people about us and be proud that we're together. But it always seemed like she wanted us to be a secret.
    
6. ***What do you not miss about being in a relationship?*** I don't miss having to deal with all the anxiety—if ever she’ll leave, if ever she realizes she doesn't like me back, if ever she's talking to someone else.
    
7. ***Write a thank you note to your ex.*** CJ, thank you for all the moments and laughter and discussions about anything and everything. Thank you for treating me as a friend. Thank you for tolerating me always leaving and coming back. You were always so kind and understanding.
    
8. ***What lessons have you learned during the breakup process?*** I realized I let her become my entire world and one second and a few words can ruin me. That shouldn't’ve been the case. 
    
9. ***What are you struggling to understand right now?*** What her reasons for breaking up with me were, and if they're even rational. I also can't understand why I can't move on and why I still think about her every single day. 
    
10. ***What’s one quality you have that makes you a great partner?*** Vulnerability. I am able to be open about my feelings and insecurities to my partner. 
    
11. ***What red flags in your relationship did you ignore?*** She refuses to communicate her feelings. She dismisses my emotional advances. She is afraid to trust me. 
    
12. ***How do you hope to move forward from here?*** I just hope to come out of this as a better person with wisdom, a better approach to relationships and breakups. I hope to know more about myself—my flaws and shortcomings—and turn them around.
    
13. ***When was the last time you cried, and why?*** The last time I cried concerning my ex was, I think, 2 months ago? I missed her and my internet friends so terribly that I cried heavily. I am still blaming myself for what happened, it saddens me that I needed to leave just to resolve issues within myself.
    
14. ***What do you wish your ex knew about you?*** That I’m very fragile, emotional and passionate. Liking her means I’ll go to the moon and back just for her and I’m hoping she does the same. 
    
15. ***Tell yourself a story about why you should move on.*** Your life is miserable. You hate yourself. You trudge through life day by day as if on autopilot. You seek something new, something that can spark your life. Then, you meet a girl—Agatha. Agatha is everything you can ask for in a woman. Smart, funny, independent, kind, beautiful—everything. You gathered up the courage to ask her out. Turns out she liked you first and she gladly accepted your offer. First date turns into second, a third one, a fourth. Until you're inseparable. It was like nothing you've ever experienced before. This feeling, the feeling of being wanted. For the first time in a long time, you were happy. You want nothing to ever ruin this. So what do you do? You held onto it, so tight, because you’re afraid it’ll slip away from your fingers. And because you held on so tight, she was suffocated. She broke free to breathe. You ruined it. You lost something you thought you’ll have forever. You got so obsessed that you forgot she was a person. Instead, you idealized her, to escape from your miserable life. You never really treated her as a person, you were just selfish. You realized it's you who's the problem. And because of that, you can't be in a healthy relationship. You need to work on yourself first before you can understand true happiness. You’ve got a long way to go but you will get there. Trust me, you will get there. 
    
16. ***What steps are you taking to create a fresh start?*** First, I figured out what was wrong with me: limerence and self-hate. With this knowledge, I can better myself. Second, I cut ties with my ex and everything that can remind me of her. Third, everyday, I write in my journal. I’m going through some kind of self-esteem therapy from a book that can help me. I’m sticking through it until the end. Fourth, I stop myself from thinking and daydreaming about what could've been. 
    
17. ***If you could go back in time, what would you do to improve your relationship?*** I should've had more patience with her struggling to open up about her feelings. I could've set aside my anxieties and let her go at her own pace. Yes, being honest and upfront were good qualities to possess but I could've waited a little bit longer. 
    
18. ***Do you truly believe you and your ex were compatible, or were you always trying to make it work?*** At some point, I could say we clicked very well. I could say we're at the same level of intellect. We always had good playful banters and serious discussions. We know how to work our way around agreements and disagreements. 
    
19. ***What emotional support do you currently have to help you through your breakup?*** My friends are always there for me whenever I feel the need to discuss my feelings and my seeming inability to move on. I also have my journal to write on. Music is also a great companion to my yearning tendencies.
    
20. ***What’s something you know now that you didn't know before***? I idealized her too much that small inconsistencies in her and my dreams disappoint me so bad. Back then, I just thought she was the one and we can work through everything. That was not the case and I see that now.
    
21. ***Are you afraid of being alone?*** I’m not. I very much pride myself for going on weeks without friend/partner interaction and still be fine. I can barely feel the loneliness but I guess sometimes I’m just masking it up by distracting myself. I’m okay with being alone but deep down, I yearn for connection. The heaviness can only be present at night.
    
22. ***Do you feel frustration over how long it takes to heal?*** Every single day. Even if I do everything in my power to just move on, I keep coming back to the very first stages of grief. I keep thinking about her and dreaming about her every single day. Sometimes, I don't want to sleep just so I can't experience dreaming about her again. 
    
23. ***In what ways were you a better person around your ex?*** I feel a sense of responsibility for myself and the people around me. I am motivated to become a better person, and I did try to be one. I am more upfront and honest and vulnerable about my feelings and thoughts. I was not afraid to love and be loved. I felt like all could be well.
    
24. ***In what ways were you a worse person around your ex?*** I always wanted her attention and opinion on me. I mold myself into some kind of likable person just so she can accept me. I also didn't like that I was very obsessive. I will re-read our past conversations when I wasn't talking to her. I would think about what she would think about me and assume things that weren't even real. I was close to being insane.
    
25. ***When did you first realize your relationship was on the rocks?*** When I was at the height of my anxiety and mental instability, and she refused to communicate. I just thought that something had to be said and done because this can't go on any longer if we're gonna build a healthy relationship, I couldn't take it anymore. 
    
26. ***Why did you and your ex break up?*** We broke up because she broke up with me. She wasn't willing to change for me and for us, so she wanted us to just be friends, to get out of commitment. Though, I think there's something deeper than that. But entertaining that thought would make me face uncertainties again and that’s not good.
    
27. ***What's something you can do today that will help you bounce back stronger?*** This. Writing about it. Talking about it, may it be to no one in particular. I just need to let things out right now because my heart and mind is in a melancholic mess. 
    
28. ***If you and your ex got back together, what do you imagine it would be like?*** It depends on what kind of person she is now and what kind of person I am now. I figured I’d be even more anxious than before. It will be like a continuation to the obsession fest that is our past relationship. 
    
29. ***What are some of the ways you contributed to problems in your relationship?*** I was too obsessive that I become anxious. Not talking to her for longer than a day could kill me. I wanted her to be by my side for every second. I wanted to feel like I matter to her always.
    
30. ***Looking back, what have you learned about yourself and your relationship in general?*** It was always doomed to fail, it was only a matter of when. I was the match stick to the bomb that is our relationship, and she was the striking ignition. 
    
31. ***In what ways are you stronger or more evolved since the ending of your relationship?*** I am more self-aware. I know what my problems are, I know what I want now and what I have to do to go through it. 
    
32. ***What regrets do you have about your relationship or the way it ended?*** I shouldn't’ve came back the first time after I cut her off. I thought I was finally okay, but I clearly wasn't. Now I know I just wanted her back. 
    
33. ***What did you learn about yourself during this relationship?*** I am capable of so much more, and that I deserve more than what she gave me, which was the bare minimum. Of course, I have my faults, but she also had her fair share of shortcomings that led to the end. 
    
34. ***Did you have time to prepare for the end of your relationship, or did it end suddenly?*** It was very abrupt, like completely out of the blue. I was fully expecting her to work things out with me but I guess she had different plans. And because it was abrupt, it hurt a lot more than I was expecting. 
    
35. ***If you could say one thing to your ex right now, what would it be?*** I apologize for leaving, coming back, and leaving again for good. I never treated you as a friend, I’m sorry. I idealized you too much that it led to eventual heartbreak. I have always liked you, that never changed. I wish it would though, because I’m tired of these emotions. You're all I can think and dream about everyday. 
    
36. ***What are your goals for the next week, month, and year of your life?*** For next week, I want to finally do a song cover for “**Safe and Sound**” by *Taylor Swift*. By next month, I should be able to move past elementary levels in Math in Khan Academy. For the next year, I want to finish Genki 2 and move on to Quartet. I want to be able to consume Japanese media and understand them. I want to be better at art and create more artworks. I want to be more confident in myself and my abilities. To be honest, I don't really set any goals, I just want to be able to continue doing what I like to do. 
    
37. ***What were some of the root causes of why your relationship didn't work?*** I was very insecure and obsessive. She was very closed off and unable to lay out her emotions. That's not a very good combination, don’t you think?
    
38. ***Write about your ideal day by yourself.*** I wake up, wash my face and go out for a morning walk. I go back home, take a quick shower, then prepare some coffee. I listen to music, check my notifications and game progress. I drink my medicine. I then study Japanese for a few hours. After that, I create art. Then, I workout for an hour. I watch a film, then read a book. By night, I journal for a bit. I floss, wash my face, brush my teeth. I listen to a podcast then write my to-do list for tomorrow. I watch ASMR videos until I fall asleep. 
    
39. ***How do you feel right now, in this moment?*** I’m just feeling very sad and melancholic. I want to go back to the way things were before I left but I know that will never happen. I miss them, I miss her, so damn much. But there's nothing I can do but to move forward from here. These feelings are temporary. 
    
40. ***What’s bothering you right now, and why?*** I keep having the same damn dreams. Me getting back together with my ex and us being happy together in real life. It bothers me because my self cannot differentiate reality from dreams. I am emotionally affected by my dreams. They make me want to get back with her. Or perhaps, it bothers me because it forces me to face my deepest desires. 
    
41. ***What does your ideal morning look like?*** I go out for a walk, grab a quick breakfast, prepare some coffee, and listen to music.
    
42. ***Name five things you’re grateful for.*** My mom, my family, a house to live in, food to eat, and my friends. 
    
43. ***What is the biggest thing in your life bringing you joy right now?*** Having the time to do things I want. Like all the free time in the world. Also, the comforts of being at home and my family having a stable income. As well as having friends to talk to whenever I need it.
    
44. ***How are your friends supporting you through this breakup?*** They're always there for me whenever I feel the need to talk about my current feelings. 
    
45. ***Are you good or bad at compartmentalizing feelings?*** Yes. When I feel things, I get overwhelmed. So I have to write them down or I’ll blow up. 
    
46. ***What were the biggest overall problems in your relationship?*** Me being obsessive and having the lowest self-esteem and her being distant and detached. That was a recipe for destruction. 
    
47. ***What did you learn from this relationship?*** We both weren't ready. It was simply not the right time. Our relationship was meant to teach us how to become better versions of ourselves. 
    
48. ***What do you need to do now in order to have closure?*** Embrace the sadness and yearning. Understand that it was meant to end and that these feelings are temporary. Know that I am feeling these things because I’m emotionally unfulfilled and I crave emotional connection with people. Just live through this. You got this.
    
49. ***What has your healing journey looked like thus far?*** It may look like I kept on running away—a part of it may be true—but I needed to run away for a while in order to not get overwhelmed by strong emotions. I needed to run away to clear my mind. It has been a rocky journey of moving on. There are periods where I’m back to where I was a night after the breakup, but I always get through it somehow. 
    
50. ***Do you feel anger about your relationship?*** Why or why not? Never. I was never angry at her or what has become of us. Come to think of it, I was more sad about everything. Not once did anger cross my emotions.

Everyone's on edge. Like at any second, they'll just burst into a tantrum. I fucking hate it. I hate this atmosphere. And it always happens when my parents are stressed. They don't know how to fucking chill. It's starting to get on my nerves.Â 

Naturally, we didn't go to the buffet. I woke up past noon. I spent my entire day watching anime. I finished ***Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann***. I'm really glad I didn't drop it. They closed off the series pretty good. The final battle scenes were top-notch. Also, I threw away my Kojic-Gluta soap. I'm still having breakouts.

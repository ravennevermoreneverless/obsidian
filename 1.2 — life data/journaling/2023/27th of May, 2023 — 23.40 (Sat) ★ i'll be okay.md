iâ€™m listening to *Boris*'s album ***boris at last -feedbacker-***. the view from outside my bedroom window is a large factory with machinery clanking and all the lights on. i opened the window and let in the fresh night air. damn all the mosquitoes. the moon is hiding somewhere. this industrial setting view is a little bit comforting despite all its rustiness and association with the mechanical world. there's so much in the world out there i've yet to experience. it's like my life is yet to begin even though it already started a long time ago. i feel so infinitesimally small. every day i feel new. i don't think my friends care that much, and i don't think i care if they don't. i don't think they'll ever understand either, or at least try to. someone out there will appreciate me the same way i'd appreciate them. this yearning for emotional connection will never be satisfied unless i do something about it. it will not go away. the only way is being. the moon appeared behind the dark purple clouds, in its shining glory. earlier i felt like the world seemed a bit too heavy. i couldn't feel anything, that was scary. but now, i think i'm okay. i'll be okay. my time will come, i can wait a little longer.

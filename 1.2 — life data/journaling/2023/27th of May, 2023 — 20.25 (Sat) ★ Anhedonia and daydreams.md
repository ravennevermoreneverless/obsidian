Numb. Empty. Void. Nothingness. Anhedonia. Unable to feel any emotion. Paralyzed. Inability to do anything than just lay in my bed and rot. I don't know what the fuck happened. One moment I’m enjoying my hobbies, the next I’m fucked up on the inside. I’ve been taking my medication, I don't know why I’m like this. They say antidepressants aren't really the quick fix that you need in depression, it just alleviates the symptoms a little bit. I’ll still feel the symptoms but just less. So if I’m not taking medication I’d feel worse. I should be thankful that it (probably) can’t get any worse than this. I also should be thankful that I can't feel the severe longing and intense limerence over my ex. I don't feel the need to check her Instagram stories or see if she viewed mine. I don't care. I am unable to give a shit. So yeah, I should be glad. I don't know what to do now though, I’ve been listening to the same song on repeat. I don't feel like doing anything but I can write, at least.

— Every time I daydream, it's always characters I fixate on, like K-pop idols or anime characters. I put myself in their image and act out a repeating elaborate scenario. I always daydream about being nonchalant, indifferent, confident, charismatic, cool, and calm. And it’s always with a woman pining over the idealized version of me. It's cringe-y, I know, but I can't avoid the fact that that’s what I daydream about. The scenario is like this: the girl confesses her love for me, saying she has loved me for many years and I was just oblivious. I would appear shocked and stunned, and don't know what to say. I wouldn't give a straight answer if I liked her back or no, the daydream usually just ends with me being shocked. That’s basically it. The sole subject of my daydreams, repeating throughout my entire life. It clearly and blatantly expresses a fundamental truth about myself: wanting to be desired. The self I daydream about is different from the real me because I am emotional, I care too much, I have low self-esteem, I have anxiety, I get overwhelmed. The complete opposite of what I daydream about. The idealized version of me is what I want to become but can’t for some reason. At the moment, I can't accept my current version of me but the path of renewal can only be opened if I accept these traits. Acceptance doesn't mean incapable of change.

— I’ve been working on this for the past couple of months. I want to change my unbelievably low self-esteem which is the cause for bad behaviors and self-loathing. I’ve read Nathaniel Branden’s The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem and I’m hoping I can remember the stuff I read there. I kept a few notes, hopefully I keep them in mind. I am always working on myself. I know when I’ve been neglecting my needs and wants. There are some aspects that I can't change, like my physical appearance (height, face) but I can change my physique by working out habitually. I can also become confident by dressing up nicely and studying more and more. I can work on myself by continuing what I’ve been doing, which is enjoying my time with my hobbies. I might be too self-indulgent but I don't want to do anything else.

— What do I dislike about others? Hmm, that might take me a while to think about. I don't really think much about others but usually disliking something about others would mean you’re kind of projecting traits within you. Oh, right, not thinking about others. Being too self-absorbed. There are ways this can reflect a person’s character, like caring very little about others, that lack of empathy, and being self-centered. I can be like that. I can get too wrapped up in my own world that I forget about others and spending time with them. I try my best to consciously listen to what they have to say and spend time with them without over-flaunting myself. I also dislike when others are too arrogant and boastful. I guess I can be like that, too. But I keep it to myself. I judge people based on what I see and I immediately categorize them if they're better than me or I’m better than them. It's a really bad habit that I need to fix. As well as dishonesty. I used to say I pride myself by always being honest but I have my moments of dishonesty and mask them by being “just being a kind person.” Bullshit. I can lie, too. I’m not bad at lying, I only pretend I am. I get nervous, sure, but when I really need it, I lie. For my own self-interest.**

I wasn't supposed to sleep today but I fell asleep some time at dawn, after watching a film, while I was listening to my playlist and reading a book. I woke up at 10 AM. I just continued reading. I finished ***Digital Minimalism*** by *Cal Newport*. It was okay. I think I have a fairly comfortable relationship with social media and my leisure time so I don't really have much to worry about. I did arm calisthenics today. I was gonna do core, too, but I got lazy. I masturbated before taking a bath. I waited for my Shopee package to come so I couldn't do much because of all the waiting. While eating corn and talking to my family, the parcel came, at around past 6 PM. It's my lip ring. My mom doesn't want me to get pierced because she's worried it'll get infected but I told her I'll get pierced once I'm living on my own. The lip ring comes off easily when I move my lip so I'll wear it when I'm not eating. I also realized my lips are quite small. I'll sleep early today.

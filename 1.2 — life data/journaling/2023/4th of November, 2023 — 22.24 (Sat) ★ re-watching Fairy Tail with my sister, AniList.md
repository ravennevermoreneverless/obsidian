I overslept. I woke up around 11 PM so I started my Japanese studies late. But I managed to do everything (except review). I didn't do legs and cardio today because I ate my lunch late, too. I'll do it tomorrow. And oh, I came back and reactivated my 3 Instagram accounts. It was lackluster, probably because I don't feel as much addiction or attachment to it as before. I don't feel the need to constantly check my story viewers, or to see other people's stories anymore. That's probably for the best. My sister and I watched *Fairy Tail* today because I have a bit of free time, a few hours. Though I don't think I can watch everyday, I'm not willing to sacrifice my sleep for a few episodes of an anime I already watched. Anyway, that's about it. Nothing much happened today. And nothing much came to my mind. I was preoccupied with studying. Oh, and I finished ***Mob Psycho III*** today. I had trouble posting a scene on Instagram because of copyright but I tried again later and I managed to have it stay up. I also followed a bunch of people on AniList, I need anime/manga mutuals so I can get recommendations from what they're watching. I don't really mind if they don't follow back, but one of them did.

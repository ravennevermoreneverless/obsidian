I wanna run away so bad. Having a noisy dog is gettingÂ  on my nerves. I'm getting more overwhelmed as days go by. I want to be in a quiet place where I can study or relax in peace. I never asked for a dog. But anything I say would sound mean and selfish. I just want to go away. When will the time come that I don't feel like wanting to run away?

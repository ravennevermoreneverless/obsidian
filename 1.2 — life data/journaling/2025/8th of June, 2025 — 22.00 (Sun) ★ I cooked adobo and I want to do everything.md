i cooked adobo today (with my mom's minimal guidance) and we got to the topic of my dad's interest in technology and fixing gadgets and my mom's interest in cooking and how none of us 4 siblings have any interest in any of those two â€” except for me. then they laughed because it seemed like i didn't. i told them i just don't have the time and that it's very difficult that i have some kind of interest in everything yet i have so little time so i can't really focus on one thing for a period of time.

i wish i had more time. i wish i can tinker with gadgets like my dad. i wish i can cook delicious dishes like my mom. i wish i can bake, i wish i can sew, i wish i can do tattoos, i wish i can swim, i wish i can do parkour, i wish i can dance, i wish i can surf, i wish i can do programming, i wish i can produce music, i wish i can write a book, i wish i can teach philosophy to students, i wish i can become a surgeon, i wish i can explore caves, i wish i can become a monk, i wish i can be part of an orchestra, etc.

there's so much to be, so much to do. such a tragic reality of life that we can only choose one path in one lifetime. but also, that's what makes the path you chose all the more worthwhile.

It's the first time I lied to my mom. I lied to her that I'm still going to work, even though I'm not, and I've already filed for my resignation. I'm looking forward to getting a new job soon, though I'm still in the application process. This is a work from home setup, which is a conflict in me and Chai's plans, especially hers. That's why I applied to more jobs today. I don't know, I still haven't gotten any response at all. Chai's a little bit sick right now and her legs hurt from all the walking and she'll be having her period soon. I feel bad for her and I want to cry because she doesn't want to be here at all and yet we're here and she's still thinking about me and I'm probably only thinking about myself. Heck, she even helped me lie to my mom and to her mom regarding my work, as well as talk to my OM. With my OM, she's asking to call me whenever I'm available. I don't think I'm available tonight. I'll be trying to do my initial interview with Cyberbacker tomorrow for the Bookkeeper position. Which is a work from home position so I'm not sure about this one right now. Chai's not in a very good condition to talk to right now so I figured I'll be on my own with my decisions, at the same time taking care of my wife. I don't know how I will manage, without the help of my mom and my family. With some little money I have left, I don't know where this will go at all.

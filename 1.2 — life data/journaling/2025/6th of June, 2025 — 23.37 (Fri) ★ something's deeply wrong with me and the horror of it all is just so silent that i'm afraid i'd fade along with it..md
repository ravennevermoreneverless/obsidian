i dont know what's happening

i dont know what i'm feeling

i feel so numb yet i feel everything

everything's so slow yet i'm being propelled forward in lightning speed

is it my mental illness? is it just simply a human condition? is it some other thing?

it's like i'm not in complete control.

i am confused all the time. did this thing happen to me? did i really say that? what did i do 10 minutes ago?

some folks would argue i'm just not living in the present-past raven would argue that. if so, where even am i? i don't remember who i was before all this. i don't think i'd remember as time goes by.

i'm losing myself and i'm starting to forget bits and pieces of me.

this is a call to the forgetful and the desperates who try and remember and grasp onto memories right before they fade.

something's deeply wrong with me and the horror of it all is just so silent that i'm afraid i'd fade along with it.

I woke up to my alarm but Chai turned it off twice and hugged me tight, even though I wanted to get up, so I just slept until 7 AM. I felt incredibly shitty because we skipped workout today because I woke up late and didn't want to do it and Chai said she was only waiting for me. So I went non-verbal and drowned in self-pity once more for an hour, while washing the dishes, until mom came home. I also caught myself making snarky remarks to everything Chai says out of irritation and frustration to defend myself for once, even though I might be in the wrong. Somehow, why do I feel like I'm always in the wrong? Always to blame? Everything I do is wrong and everything I attempt and try to do good is still wrong? That's what upsets me a lot. And keeps on upsetting me over and over. I'm trying my best, but somehow it's still not enough. I don't know what kind of self-pity party I have here or my feelings are valid and they're just invalidating it. But anyway, because of that, I'm becoming bitter, resentful, and apathetic. Mom came home and cooked lunch. Dad came home and ate lunch. Globe came by and installed the Wi-Fi while Chai and I bathed Cheesecake after she peed outside and encountered our pissy snobbish woman neighbor. I searched up words for Kanji practice and also did repetitive Kanji writing for each character. Chai recommended me this penpal app with Japanese speakers called ***Shimagurashi*** and I've been so stoked about using it that I kept checking up on it. Chai and I watched X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) directed by Bryan Singers, even though it kept getting cut off because of the website and because I'm helping mom with laundry. But anyways, I'm not gonna sleep yet because I'm still helping mom with laundry. But I felt like hurting myself in the morning just to prove a point, and elated by the evening because of the internet. Oh, and we got free 800mbps for 2 years. How cool is that?

Do you believe in destiny? That sounded a bit cheesy, but I just think there’s a reason why I couldn’t get into animation this year in the school that I want even though I already passed the admission test. A reason meaning an opportunity for something else.

Lately, I haven’t been creating a lot, I’m in some sort of art block. I’m starting to find myself hating what I make and setting up expectations/pressure on myself to reach as much audience as possible and make conventional art. I hate my art and I hate myself even more for being too perfectionistic. But then I saw this Reddit post:

> “I'm going to stop caring now
> 
> Im gonna finally say it : fuck trying to get good. Im sick of feeling so negative and terrible about my art all the time. Im finally going to change that and become happier with what I make. Ive been forcing anime and pretty styles onto myself and its awful. I love the art and admire the artists who can create such beautiful pieces, I just dont love making art in complex and fancy styles.
> 
> Im going to draw like moomins and over the garden wall and as simple as it gets because that what makes me happy. If no one likes it, then good for them. I dont care. If im the worst, then so be it, I can be the best at being the worst and Ill be proud doing it because ill be happy.
> 
> Thank you to this subreddit, I have read several advice posts and this has finally convinced me to just go for what I want after 3 years of negativity and depression from art. Im doing what I want, I am happy.”

I almost felt like crying because of how much a reassurance it was for me right now. Hearing the words “fuck trying to get good” makes me so free and liberated. Earlier I posted my shitty doodles—which aren’t shitty now because I enjoyed making them—and I think I’m gonna make my art account as ugly as possible (and by ugly I mean raw and authentic and me). I posted the quote on my wall just to remind me every single day that it’s absolutely o-fucking-kay to be terrible at something as long as you’re proud of it and you’re happy.

When I asked if you believe in destiny, I meant if there was a reason for something not going the way you’ve planned it. I think, making art as my career will potentially make me hate creating at all. I’m very sensitive when it comes to creating, as you can see, and I think pursuing an art career and getting into the industry will just ruin art for me entirely. I treasure art too much to make it a profession. Therefore, I think I’ll just take a year off once more, to study for entrance exams and have plenty of time to think about any other course that interests me and which I can tolerate for work.

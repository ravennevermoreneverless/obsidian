Somewhere around this planet, you exist. I will have the knowledge that you do but I wouldn’t really know where you are—but you do exist. Our memories together proved you and I exist in this world, this dimension, this reality. Existing together, we once were, but know that we’re only existing separately doesn’t make it any less important. It may seem like I threw it all so easily but it’s my greatest heartbreak yet. It feels like I’ve lost it all and that I lost but it feels just right. When you lose people and you’ve found yourself, they say you’ve won. Maybe I did won, I probably am winning, right? I am now walking towards a place that I’ve been dreaming of; the road is scary, it’s terrifying, everything is uncertain but I won’t let you come with me anymore. Someday, somehow, you’ll replace our memories with other people; you’ll replace me, and that’s okay. It will hurt for a little while, I’m sorry about that. I will carry this bittersweet guilt to my grave. But soon, you’ll forget me. However, I hope you remember me in songs, in whispers and in quiet existence—even just in passing. You may forget my name, but remember how I made you laugh and how I left you notes to remember me by. It hurts me the same as it hurts you but this is for the best. I wish you all the best. Never look for me.

I was scrolling through Facebook and came across a friend/schoolmate/classmate back then who I taught how to draw (that’s way back in elementary and I doubt he even learned anything valuable) but I was shocked with how good he is now in producing arts. He’s so good with digital and I can’t even construct one digital art properly. At first, of course, I felt insecure and inadequate. How can he have improved so well so fast? Then it kicked in; the mature sensible version of myself and jumped at me saying: “You go your own pace. Be proud of how far you’ve come. Back then, you’d have a 6-month long art block and now you’re excited to create everyday. So what if he’s better than you in digital arts? Can he draw portraits as well as you? He can’t even begin to amount to your style because that’s you and that’s him. That doesn’t make you lesser of an artist, especially not of a human being. There’s always gonna be someone better than you one way or another, that can’t be helped. But you have to keep in mind that you’re doing amazing, you’ve come so far and you’re you; no one can replicate that.” And dear god, the character development I have. Happy new year, indeed.

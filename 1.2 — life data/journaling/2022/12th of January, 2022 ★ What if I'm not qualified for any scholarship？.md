After being distracted for more than 10 days, the pressure of applying to colleges haunted me once again. I worry a lot, I get overwhelmed very easily. All I can think about is what if I don’t pass the entrance exam? What if I’m not qualified for any scholarship? What if I’m not good enough? These questions loom over me again and again, never stopping to rest. I don’t have a lot of options for college, and if I failed those two choices I have, what do I do then? I’m very worried and while I know fear and worry is the mind killer, it is my biggest enemy. I have anxiety so it can’t be helped. I mean, it can but it’s very hard.

I’m not really sure who to turn to or who I should talk to regarding this, I barely have any guidance. Everyone’s just expecting me to know what to do but I don’t. I may look it sometimes but I haven’t got my shit together. I don’t even think my artworks are good enough to pass as an art portfolio piece.

What’s even more frustrating is I know I’m being irrational and I still have to do better but it’s weighing down on me harshly. I can almost feel the crushing heaviness of it every time I wake up. All I can think about is “do better” but I’m afraid to overwork myself because it certainly won’t help. I’m doing my best, I just hope it’s enough.
